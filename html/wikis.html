		<h1>Our Wikis</h1>
		<h2><a href="http://www.kotos.fandom.com">Knights of the Olde Speech Wiki</a></h2>
		<p>Created by Haroldosaur in 2016, the Knights of the Olde Speech wiki was built with the purpose of housing the stories of the Knights of the Olde Speech series and relevant information. After the LEGO Message Boards shut down, it went beyond collecting our stories and organising the series and officially became our base. It was the first wiki of the GDC our members ever created and the one that inspired the making of the rest.</p>
		<p>The Knights of the Olde Speech story follows the titular group of characters -inspired by the real-life KOTOS, who are basically a bunch of writer friends who like Olde Speech- as they are hired to fend the futuristic Paradox Rogues led by the evil thedude7500 and his sidekick Barney off the medieval land of Morcia. While their adventures continue, many more side stories branch off of the main one following characters all across Militiregnum (Morcia's planet) or beyond. The KOTOS Story Universe draws elements from LEGO Universe, Knights' Kingdom II and the real-life history of the KotOS as well as expand its world greatly with original content.</p>
		<h2><a href="http://www.poaseries.fandom.com">Power of Ages Wiki</a></h2>
		<p>Power of Ages is a series written by Haroldosaur based on the LEGO Universe game (like all the stories mentioned here to some grade), starring Pandemonium's Bane, an offshoot branch of the Nexus Force that works as independent special task force of people with super powers (called Savants).</p>
		<p>This wiki now serves to host the PoA story and it is where you will find updates to it.</p>
		<h2><a href="http://www.shadow-book-stories.fandom.com">Shadow Book Wiki</a></h2>
		<p>"The Shadow Book provides many insights on the events of the First Maelstrom War when the Darkitect first rose and the Nexus Force was founded. Through these stories, recounted by the anonymous writer calling himself 'Shadow' or in some cases translated from ancient languages, reveal many points of Crux's history, through the point of view of particular individuals, who often played important roles in it"</p>
		<p>Here you shall find all about the stories contained in the Shadow Book, written by fffffplayer1 <strike>as far as we know in this universe</strike> (when he's not lazing around). </p>
		<h2><a href="http://www.chanora-and-the-cod.fandom.com">Chanora and the COD Wiki</a></h2>
		<p>The Chanoran Series is written by Theo Emerson, following the story of James and Rebecca Walters (and possibly others). A better summary is probably needed, but I'll write it when I have it.</p>
		<h2><a href="http://www.talmidstories.fandom.com">Leek Works</a></h2>
		<p>This wiki is where Talmid uploads a lot of his personal stories, including the Stromling Trilogy, Transdimensional Maneuvers and Song of the Swans.</p>
