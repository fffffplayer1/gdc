		<h1>The LEGO Message Boards Archives</h1>
		<p>During my time on the LEGO Message Boards, I've seen two archives of the forums get created. The first one in June 2016 when several old forums were retired and merged with the Classics forum with the result of many topics getting lost; and the second in March 2017 when the LEGO Message Boards as a whole shut down.</p>
		<h2>The Talmid Archive</h2>
		<p>In late May/early June, we received the sudden message that the forums of some discontinued themes, including LEGO Universe and Bionicle (I remember these because the archives have topics of both, but I believe there were more) would be soon closing. Some topics would be moved to the Classics forums, but only the recent ones, while a technical problem prevented the site's devs to move topics that were too long (which wasn't very pleasant since we were kinda attached to those). So, we had to find a way to preserve our legacy without having to go through hundreds or thousands of pages manually. Talmid from the LU community thankfully presented somewhat of a solution.</p>
		<p>Getting help from some people he knew in real life, a script was written to automatically download all of a topic's HTML pages. The solution was far from perfect (only a limited number of topics was saved; the files saved were only HTML pages linking to CSS and JS hosted by the lego.com website</p>
