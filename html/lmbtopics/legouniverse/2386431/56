                    Chapter 45<BR /><BR /><BR />Against her better judgment, as well as her recently developed stealth instincts, Reyna had to stop thinking for a spell so she could remember to breath.  She had known this would happen, they had all known, but it was still pretty unbearable to see two of her closest friends go out on such impossible missions and not come back.  But she still needed to GET A GRIP!!!<BR /><BR />She gritted her teeth, and reviewed the remaining plans on the map she had hastily drawn last night.  It was very fortunate she had thought to do so, because now they needed it more than ever.  Their target had almost reached his destination, and once that happened, they would go from being the hunters to the hunted, and defeat would be virtually inevitable.  They needed to take the target out, and they needed to do it NOW!!<BR /><BR />Again, Reyna had to remind herself to breath.  As if her sarcastic tendencies were even starting to rub off on her involuntary functions, her breaths became exasperated and elongated huffs.  ARRGH!!  It was official.  She was losing it.<BR /><BR />Reyna inhaled… and exhaled… slowly…. No, she was not out for the count.  Not yet.  First, she had a job to do, and it was now or never.  <BR /><BR />She dug through her pocket until she found what she was looking for.  She pulled out the device, and stared at it for what seemed like an eternity.  Yes, if she were to use it, it would be cheating, but hey, all the odds were against them from the start.  It wasn’t like she’d be any worse off trying to make them a little more even.<BR /><BR />But still… it would have to be as a last resort.  Yes, they had all agreed, they wouldn’t show all their cards until the endgame.  This decision was only made double by the fact that they were approaching the endgame all too quickly; they honestly hadn’t expected to get picked off so easily, although now Reyna knew they should’ve seen it coming.<BR /><BR />Reyna studied the map again.  It was clear that they would be done before they could get through even half the plans they had made, so Reyna decided it was time to skip a few.  Plan B was a failure… no, not any more than could reasonably be expected.  They had always known it would end up being a suicide mission, just like Plan A.  What mattered now was making the best attempt they could at capturing or incapacitating their target, before there were none of them left to do it.  <BR /><BR />With this in mind, she folded up the map and stood up.  Once everything was ready, she reviewed the plans with Jonathon, bade him one last farewell, and disappeared into the jungle of a forest.  <BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />When she heard the target approaching, Reyna’s heart sped up.  This was what she had been waiting for, why she had hung from the thicket of tree branches over the path for the last hour and a half, but still she didn’t feel like she was ready.  But then again, who would?<BR /><BR />When her target finally came into sight, her nerves had been wracked so long from waiting that she recklessly descended down to the ground from her position prematurely.  Crux!  Because of her mistake, the target knew she was present before he was within range.  Now she had to move fast, or-<BR /><BR />Reyna leapt to the side to avoid the rain of weapon fire that shredded up the ground where she had been less than two seconds ago, and disappeared into the thick forest growth on the side of the path.  Now she was invisible again, to an extent.  Invisibility was largely dependent on whoever was around not knowing you were there, and Reyna had lost that advantage.  Now speed was equally as important as stealth.  <BR /><BR />She emerged from the undergrowth directly behind the target, and did not wait a fraction of a second before attacking with her dual-katanas.  Unfortunately, this had very little effect on the target other than telling his fist where to find her face.  With a grunt, Reyna went flying backwards, eventually crashing straight into one of the larger redwoods in the area.  Her daze was short-lived, for half a second later the target had grasped her by the throat and held her up against the tree.  <BR /><BR />Reyna tried to pry the fingers from her throat, but their grip only increased, sending a wave of fatigue and panic through her body as it begged for oxygen.  As Reyna’s senses started to go from the stage of panic to the stage of weary acceptance, the realization of what this meant terrified her and sent another wave of panic through her, keeping her alive but even more exhausted.  She desperately tried to cling to reality as she started to slip away.  Any second longer and she’d start to… she didn’t know how much longer… if she’d be able to stay… conscious….<BR /><BR />With a mute, breathless scream, Reyna lashed out at the target with her lower body, grabbing his waist in her legs and pulling them both to the ground.  This made the target’s grip slacken enough for Reyna to break free, and taste sweet air before jumping off the ground in a backflip intended to create some distance between her and the target.  By the time she came out of it, however, she barely had time to jerk her head to the side to avoid being crushed by the oncoming fist of the all-too-quickly recovering target.  She lurched from side to side as she dodged a relentless assault of martial arts that still surpassed her own, and tried to think up a new plan.  And then she remembered her first one.  <BR /><BR />With a battle cry that sucked out all the oxygen she had just regained, Reyna unleashed a barrage of bladed projectiles towards the target.  The target easily dodged the whizzing blades, which stuck harmlessly into the great redwood behind him.  What the target failed to realize was that he hadn’t actually been what Reyna had aimed for, as displayed by the smile on her face.  <BR /><BR />With a grunt, Reyna yanked on a series of near-invisible strings, which were connected at the other end to each of the blades.  It wasn’t until the looming shadow of the redwood fell over him that the target realized the deception.<BR /><BR />With a mighty crash that shook the forest, Reyna brought the redwood to the ground, right on top of the target.  The target couldn’t have had time to react, and was right underneath it when it landed.  Reyna froze in her position, still holding the deadly wires in her hands.  There was no movement.  <BR /><BR />Slowly, Reyna became aware of the sound of her own desperate breaths, as well as the fact that it was the only sound around.  Was this really possible?  Had she actually WON?!!<BR /><BR />The persisting silence seemed like proof, and so with a tiny laugh of relief, she turned around.<BR /><BR />…And almost bumped into the target.<BR /><BR />“I’m sorry, Shin’ika,” he said, as he landed the final blow.<BR />

                    Chapter 46<BR /><BR /><BR />Three down, one to go.  Disappointed didn’t even begin to describe how the Major felt.  Yes, the exercise was a bit harsh, but he had given them as many advantages as was plausible: a head start, time to prepare, even their faction gear, which according to his analysis was actually significantly higher-grade equipment than standard issue; it seemed A.N.C. not only had the best trainers, but the best gear as well.  Not only that, but the exercise was statistically four to one in their favor.  If they had attacked him together, they would’ve stood a much greater chance.  Hadn’t he told them they would need to show him they could work TOGETHER?!! Wasn’t that THE POINT??!!!!<BR /><BR />The Major needed to calm down, but he just couldn’t.  Praxer’s suicidal attack had gotten him so wound up he could hardly think straight.  Luckily it wasn’t affecting his effectiveness in battle to a great extent, but it sure made it bricking hard to look at the big picture.  <BR /><BR />And now Jonathon was the only one left.  Why the other trainees continued to hold the boy back and take the risks for him, even after the Major had specifically told them not to, the Major would probably never understand.  Well, maybe he could, but still he would pretend not to until the exercise was over.  <BR /><BR />The exercise itself was deceptively simple: the kids had to track down, target, and eliminate a very elusive prey before it got to the edge of the forest.  Simple, until the true nature of the target was revealed.  <BR /><BR />They were hunting the Major.  <BR /><BR />And this time he wasn’t holding back.  <BR /><BR />The Major sighed.  Yes, this may have been expecting too much of them, but from the way they were going down one by one, it was almost as if they weren’t even trying!  He was playing the defense, and they were playing the offense.  Right now they should have had the edge.  But once he made it to the other end of the forest, their roles would switch.  He had hidden a weapons cache there the night before, and most of his tactical equipment was in there: his spare faction-kit fusions, the extra attachments for his Space Marine kit (including all external weapons for it, such as his dual pistols), basically anything that could count as an offensive weapon.  His other gear, such as consumables and items for trade, were back at the camp, just to keep things simple.  Once the Major reached the cache, the odds would no longer be tipped in his opposition’s favor.  <BR /><BR />But his opposition was being a bunch of idiots!!<BR /><BR />Again, the Major realized he had to relax.  If getting to the cache and reversing the roles of hunter and hunted was what it would take to get through to them, so be it.  They weren’t learning the easy way, so he’d have to teach them the hard way.<BR /><BR />So, as he trekked to the end of the forest, the last thing on his mind was wondering where his fourth opponent was.<BR /><BR />But as he emerged from the shadows that faced the weapons cache, the small sound of a drawstring being released in front of him told him that it should have been the first.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />The Major ducked to the side as a volley of arrows whizzed over his head in a blur.  Crux!  He hadn’t bothered to conceal the cache, and now he had walked right into a trap.  Jonathon had been lying in wait at the cache the whole time, and was now shooting at him with an endless stream of arrows.  <BR /><BR />For the first time in the exercise, the Major had been caught off guard.<BR /><BR />He took cover in a thicket to the right of where he had first come out, and did a half-second systems check.  Everything appeared to be okay for the time being.  Jonathon’s ambush had just surprised him was all.<BR /><BR />As he calibrated his armor more thoroughly, he noticed that his systems were starting to heat up, even though they weren’t in use.  Cautiously, he sniffed the air, and peered out through the thicket.  His vision was blocked by a flickering orange wall of- <BR /><BR />Oh Nexus.<BR /><BR />As fast as he could manage, he leapt out of the bush Jon had set ablaze, and rushed over to find less flammable cover.  The arrows from Jonathon’s bow rained down twelve at a time, and his side had no defense but the speed at which he moved.  As the arrows singed his back, he dived into a roll that landed him behind a large stone that would hopefully provide ample cover.  In one motion, he drew each of his twin blasters and charged them one at a time.  Once they were both locked and loaded, he emerged from his cover and before fired wherever he saw movement, not wasting the time it took to look for a target by its identity.  By the time his vision had been able to identify Jonathon, the boy was being blown back by the impact of the attack.  The boy crashed backwards into the weapons cache, causing one or two of the crates to topple over and almost explode.  The Major didn’t give him any time to recover, and was on top of Jonathon before he knew what hit him.  The Major tried to pin Jonathon down by grabbing his wrists, and the boy responded by thrusting forward and delivering a sharp headbutt that sent them both reeling.  The Major recovered first, however, and before the boy could notch another arrow he delivered a swift roundhouse kick that brought the boy down, but more importantly loosened his grip on the bow enough to separate it from its master once and for all.  Undeterred, Jonathon drew his katana, and swept it back and forth, keeping the Major at bay just out of arms reach.  <BR /><BR />With a yell, the Major grabbed a long piece of broken metal from the broken parts of the cache, and started advancing on Jonathon on with an equal weapon.  Just as his makeshift staff was about to break through the boy’s defenses, Jonathon leapt back and charged forward, leaping into the air to deliver a superhuman flying kick that blew the Major back twelve feet.  Before Jonathon could redouble on his opponent, however, the Major activated his jetpack, while he was still face-down in the ground.  Propelled by his awkwardly-angled jetpack, the Major lurched forward horizontally rather than vertically, sending him flying right back into Jonathon with equally superhuman strength.  But instead of letting the momentum carry Jonathon away, he grabbed the boy, and barrel rolled until their momentum corkscrewed and angled them into the air.  This momentum, in coordination with the jetpack, carried them both straight into the sky for quite a ways… before they faltered a second too soon.  Crux!  The Major had not anticipated for gravity to win so quickly…<BR /><BR />But then as he looked down at distant but fast-approaching ground, the Major realized they were more than high enough.  <BR /><BR />While his mind focused on this, it was not paying attention to Jonathon, and the boy took this distraction to the full of his advantage, breaking free of the Major’s grip.  Startled, the Major repeatedly swung at the boy with his fists, but the boy maneuvered through the freefall expertly and easily dodged.  This frenzy continued as they descended at terminal velocity for several seconds before Jonathon finally retaliated with an uppercut that flipped the Major over and spun him around in the air.  When the Major came to his senses, Jonathon had moved in and had tightly grasped his wrists in an effort to position the Major underneath him.  Realizing what the boy was trying to do, the Major pushed back, and wrestled desperately against the hold of his opponent.  By that point the ground rushing up to meet them began to no longer seem distant at all, and this drove the Major’s instincts into a panic.  With mere moments left before impact, the Major thrust his head into Jonathon’s, making the boy flinch just long enough for the Major to finally turn them both around, and finally succeed in repositioning himself on top of the boy- <BR /><BR />-Three seconds before they hit the ground.<BR /><BR />The sickening thud could be heard for miles around.  <BR /><BR />Some say it could be heard from as far as the opposite edge of the forest.  <BR /><BR />Some protest that it could be heard even farther, as far as all across the Jade Hills.  <BR /><BR />And some say, one way or another, it could be heard from across the entire planet.  <BR /><BR />The Major didn’t hear a thing.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />When he finally came to his senses, the Major’s ears were ringing louder than ten thousand gongs.  His head was pounding so hard, he felt sure it would explode if he tried to move, or even think!  But reluctantly he did.<BR /><BR />As he forced himself to make an attempt at standing up, he felt something underneath his sore arms, something warm…<BR /><BR />Oh no.<BR /><BR />Forgetting the pounding in his head, he desperately moved off the limp body underneath him and moved it into a stable position.  He examined the boy, dreading every moment.  If he had been the one on top and still been knocked out for who knows how long, there was no telling what state Jonathon was in.<BR /><BR />A close examination revealed that the boy was not dead, but definitely unconscious.  The Major gave a sigh of relief, before realizing what that meant in the long term.<BR /><BR />The kids had failed the exercise.<BR /><BR />The Major almost lost it again, but stopped himself.  He didn’t have time for that right now; there was far too much work to be done.<BR /><BR />With exhausted tears streaming down his face, the Major picked up the boy in his arms and carried him to where they needed to be.  There was no delaying it now.  He needed to have a serious talk with all of his trainees.<BR /><BR />The fact that he still called them trainees only redoubled his tears.<BR />

                    <BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD>Chapter 46<BR /><BR /><BR />Three down, one to go.  Disappointed didn’t even begin to describe how the Major felt.  Yes, the exercise was a bit harsh, but he had given them as many advantages as was plausible: a head start, time to prepare, even their faction gear, which according to his analysis was actually significantly higher-grade equipment than standard issue; it seemed A.N.C. not only had the best trainers, but the best gear as well.  Not only that, but the exercise was statistically four to one in their favor.  If they had attacked him together, they would’ve stood a much greater chance.  Hadn’t he told them they would need to show him they could work TOGETHER?!! Wasn’t that THE POINT??!!!!<BR /><BR />The Major needed to calm down, but he just couldn’t.  Praxer’s suicidal attack had gotten him so wound up he could hardly think straight.  Luckily it wasn’t affecting his effectiveness in battle to a great extent, but it sure made it bricking hard to look at the big picture.  <BR /><BR />And now Jonathon was the only one left.  Why the other trainees continued to hold the boy back and take the risks for him, even after the Major had specifically told them not to, the Major would probably never understand.  Well, maybe he could, but still he would pretend not to until the exercise was over.  <BR /><BR />The exercise itself was deceptively simple: the kids had to track down, target, and eliminate a very elusive prey before it got to the edge of the forest.  Simple, until the true nature of the target was revealed.  <BR /><BR />They were hunting the Major.  <BR /><BR />And this time he wasn’t holding back.  <BR /><BR />The Major sighed.  Yes, this may have been expecting too much of them, but from the way they were going down one by one, it was almost as if they weren’t even trying!  He was playing the defense, and they were playing the offense.  Right now they should have had the edge.  But once he made it to the other end of the forest, their roles would switch.  He had hidden a weapons cache there the night before, and most of his tactical equipment was in there: his spare faction-kit fusions, the extra attachments for his Space Marine kit (including all external weapons for it, such as his dual pistols), basically anything that could count as an offensive weapon.  His other gear, such as consumables and items for trade, were back at the camp, just to keep things simple.  Once the Major reached the cache, the odds would no longer be tipped in his opposition’s favor.  <BR /><BR />But his opposition was being a bunch of idiots!!<BR /><BR />Again, the Major realized he had to relax.  If getting to the cache and reversing the roles of hunter and hunted was what it would take to get through to them, so be it.  They weren’t learning the easy way, so he’d have to teach them the hard way.<BR /><BR />So, as he trekked to the end of the forest, the last thing on his mind was wondering where his fourth opponent was.<BR /><BR />But as he emerged from the shadows that faced the weapons cache, the small sound of a drawstring being released in front of him told him that it should have been the first.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />The Major ducked to the side as a volley of arrows whizzed over his head in a blur.  Crux!  He hadn’t bothered to conceal the cache, and now he had walked right into a trap.  Jonathon had been lying in wait at the cache the whole time, and was now shooting at him with an endless stream of arrows.  <BR /><BR />For the first time in the exercise, the Major had been caught off guard.<BR /><BR />He took cover in a thicket to the right of where he had first come out, and did a half-second systems check.  Everything appeared to be okay for the time being.  Jonathon’s ambush had just surprised him was all.<BR /><BR />As he calibrated his armor more thoroughly, he noticed that his systems were starting to heat up, even though they weren’t in use.  Cautiously, he sniffed the air, and peered out through the thicket.  His vision was blocked by a flickering orange wall of- <BR /><BR />Oh Nexus.<BR /><BR />As fast as he could manage, he leapt out of the bush Jon had set ablaze, and rushed over to find less flammable cover.  The arrows from Jonathon’s bow rained down twelve at a time, and his side had no defense but the speed at which he moved.  As the arrows singed his back, he dived into a roll that landed him behind a large stone that would hopefully provide ample cover.  In one motion, he drew each of his twin blasters and charged them one at a time.  Once they were both locked and loaded, he emerged from his cover and before fired wherever he saw movement, not wasting the time it took to look for a target by its identity.  By the time his vision had been able to identify Jonathon, the boy was being blown back by the impact of the attack.  The boy crashed backwards into the weapons cache, causing one or two of the crates to topple over and almost explode.  The Major didn’t give him any time to recover, and was on top of Jonathon before he knew what hit him.  The Major tried to pin Jonathon down by grabbing his wrists, and the boy responded by thrusting forward and delivering a sharp headbutt that sent them both reeling.  The Major recovered first, however, and before the boy could notch another arrow he delivered a swift roundhouse kick that brought the boy down, but more importantly loosened his grip on the bow enough to separate it from its master once and for all.  Undeterred, Jonathon drew his katana, and swept it back and forth, keeping the Major at bay just out of arms reach.  <BR /><BR />With a yell, the Major grabbed a long piece of broken metal from the broken parts of the cache, and started advancing on Jonathon on with an equal weapon.  Just as his makeshift staff was about to break through the boy’s defenses, Jonathon leapt back and charged forward, leaping into the air to deliver a superhuman flying kick that blew the Major back twelve feet.  Before Jonathon could redouble on his opponent, however, the Major activated his jetpack, while he was still face-down in the ground.  Propelled by his awkwardly-angled jetpack, the Major lurched forward horizontally rather than vertically, sending him flying right back into Jonathon with equally superhuman strength.  But instead of letting the momentum carry Jonathon away, he grabbed the boy, and barrel rolled until their momentum corkscrewed and angled them into the air.  This momentum, in coordination with the jetpack, carried them both straight into the sky for quite a ways… before they faltered a second too soon.  Crux!  The Major had not anticipated for gravity to win so quickly…<BR /><BR />But then as he looked down at distant but fast-approaching ground, the Major realized they were more than high enough.  <BR /><BR />While his mind focused on this, it was not paying attention to Jonathon, and the boy took this distraction to the full of his advantage, breaking free of the Major’s grip.  Startled, the Major repeatedly swung at the boy with his fists, but the boy maneuvered through the freefall expertly and easily dodged.  This frenzy continued as they descended at terminal velocity for several seconds before Jonathon finally retaliated with an uppercut that flipped the Major over and spun him around in the air.  When the Major came to his senses, Jonathon had moved in and had tightly grasped his wrists in an effort to position the Major underneath him.  Realizing what the boy was trying to do, the Major pushed back, and wrestled desperately against the hold of his opponent.  By that point the ground rushing up to meet them began to no longer seem distant at all, and this drove the Major’s instincts into a panic.  With mere moments left before impact, the Major thrust his head into Jonathon’s, making the boy flinch just long enough for the Major to finally turn them both around, and finally succeed in repositioning himself on top of the boy- <BR /><BR />-Three seconds before they hit the ground.<BR /><BR />The sickening thud could be heard for miles around.  <BR /><BR />Some say it could be heard from as far as the opposite edge of the forest.  <BR /><BR />Some protest that it could be heard even farther, as far as all across the Jade Hills.  <BR /><BR />And some say, one way or another, it could be heard from across the entire planet.  <BR /><BR />The Major didn’t hear a thing.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />When he finally came to his senses, the Major’s ears were ringing louder than ten thousand gongs.  His head was pounding so hard, he felt sure it would explode if he tried to move, or even think!  But reluctantly he did.<BR /><BR />As he forced himself to make an attempt at standing up, he felt something underneath his sore arms, something warm…<BR /><BR />Oh no.<BR /><BR />Forgetting the pounding in his head, he desperately moved off the limp body underneath him and moved it into a stable position.  He examined the boy, dreading every moment.  If he had been the one on top and still been knocked out for who knows how long, there was no telling what state Jonathon was in.<BR /><BR />A close examination revealed that the boy was not dead, but definitely unconscious.  The Major gave a sigh of relief, before realizing what that meant in the long term.<BR /><BR />The kids had failed the exercise.<BR /><BR />The Major almost lost it again, but stopped himself.  He didn’t have time for that right now; there was far too much work to be done.<BR /><BR />With exhausted tears streaming down his face, the Major picked up the boy in his arms and carried him to where they needed to be.  There was no delaying it now.  He needed to have a serious talk with all of his trainees.<BR /><BR />The fact that he still called them trainees only redoubled his tears.<BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Hmm, Johnathan is going to turn out to be something!  If the others had been there to back him up, they would definitely have won!<BR /><BR />Poor Major, team training is always hard I know...<BR /><BR />-Goody Vensonite

                    <BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD>Chapter 46<BR /><BR /><BR />Three down, one to go.  Disappointed didn’t even begin to describe how the Major felt.  Yes, the exercise was a bit harsh, but he had given them as many advantages as was plausible: a head start, time to prepare, even their faction gear, which according to his analysis was actually significantly higher-grade equipment than standard issue; it seemed A.N.C. not only had the best trainers, but the best gear as well.  Not only that, but the exercise was statistically four to one in their favor.  If they had attacked him together, they would’ve stood a much greater chance.  Hadn’t he told them they would need to show him they could work TOGETHER?!! Wasn’t that THE POINT??!!!!<BR /><BR />The Major needed to calm down, but he just couldn’t.  Praxer’s suicidal attack had gotten him so wound up he could hardly think straight.  Luckily it wasn’t affecting his effectiveness in battle to a great extent, but it sure made it bricking hard to look at the big picture.  <BR /><BR />And now Jonathon was the only one left.  Why the other trainees continued to hold the boy back and take the risks for him, even after the Major had specifically told them not to, the Major would probably never understand.  Well, maybe he could, but still he would pretend not to until the exercise was over.  <BR /><BR />The exercise itself was deceptively simple: the kids had to track down, target, and eliminate a very elusive prey before it got to the edge of the forest.  Simple, until the true nature of the target was revealed.  <BR /><BR />They were hunting the Major.  <BR /><BR />And this time he wasn’t holding back.  <BR /><BR />The Major sighed.  Yes, this may have been expecting too much of them, but from the way they were going down one by one, it was almost as if they weren’t even trying!  He was playing the defense, and they were playing the offense.  Right now they should have had the edge.  But once he made it to the other end of the forest, their roles would switch.  He had hidden a weapons cache there the night before, and most of his tactical equipment was in there: his spare faction-kit fusions, the extra attachments for his Space Marine kit (including all external weapons for it, such as his dual pistols), basically anything that could count as an offensive weapon.  His other gear, such as consumables and items for trade, were back at the camp, just to keep things simple.  Once the Major reached the cache, the odds would no longer be tipped in his opposition’s favor.  <BR /><BR />But his opposition was being a bunch of idiots!!<BR /><BR />Again, the Major realized he had to relax.  If getting to the cache and reversing the roles of hunter and hunted was what it would take to get through to them, so be it.  They weren’t learning the easy way, so he’d have to teach them the hard way.<BR /><BR />So, as he trekked to the end of the forest, the last thing on his mind was wondering where his fourth opponent was.<BR /><BR />But as he emerged from the shadows that faced the weapons cache, the small sound of a drawstring being released in front of him told him that it should have been the first.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />The Major ducked to the side as a volley of arrows whizzed over his head in a blur.  Crux!  He hadn’t bothered to conceal the cache, and now he had walked right into a trap.  Jonathon had been lying in wait at the cache the whole time, and was now shooting at him with an endless stream of arrows.  <BR /><BR />For the first time in the exercise, the Major had been caught off guard.<BR /><BR />He took cover in a thicket to the right of where he had first come out, and did a half-second systems check.  Everything appeared to be okay for the time being.  Jonathon’s ambush had just surprised him was all.<BR /><BR />As he calibrated his armor more thoroughly, he noticed that his systems were starting to heat up, even though they weren’t in use.  Cautiously, he sniffed the air, and peered out through the thicket.  His vision was blocked by a flickering orange wall of- <BR /><BR />Oh Nexus.<BR /><BR />As fast as he could manage, he leapt out of the bush Jon had set ablaze, and rushed over to find less flammable cover.  The arrows from Jonathon’s bow rained down twelve at a time, and his side had no defense but the speed at which he moved.  As the arrows singed his back, he dived into a roll that landed him behind a large stone that would hopefully provide ample cover.  In one motion, he drew each of his twin blasters and charged them one at a time.  Once they were both locked and loaded, he emerged from his cover and before fired wherever he saw movement, not wasting the time it took to look for a target by its identity.  By the time his vision had been able to identify Jonathon, the boy was being blown back by the impact of the attack.  The boy crashed backwards into the weapons cache, causing one or two of the crates to topple over and almost explode.  The Major didn’t give him any time to recover, and was on top of Jonathon before he knew what hit him.  The Major tried to pin Jonathon down by grabbing his wrists, and the boy responded by thrusting forward and delivering a sharp headbutt that sent them both reeling.  The Major recovered first, however, and before the boy could notch another arrow he delivered a swift roundhouse kick that brought the boy down, but more importantly loosened his grip on the bow enough to separate it from its master once and for all.  Undeterred, Jonathon drew his katana, and swept it back and forth, keeping the Major at bay just out of arms reach.  <BR /><BR />With a yell, the Major grabbed a long piece of broken metal from the broken parts of the cache, and started advancing on Jonathon on with an equal weapon.  Just as his makeshift staff was about to break through the boy’s defenses, Jonathon leapt back and charged forward, leaping into the air to deliver a superhuman flying kick that blew the Major back twelve feet.  Before Jonathon could redouble on his opponent, however, the Major activated his jetpack, while he was still face-down in the ground.  Propelled by his awkwardly-angled jetpack, the Major lurched forward horizontally rather than vertically, sending him flying right back into Jonathon with equally superhuman strength.  But instead of letting the momentum carry Jonathon away, he grabbed the boy, and barrel rolled until their momentum corkscrewed and angled them into the air.  This momentum, in coordination with the jetpack, carried them both straight into the sky for quite a ways… before they faltered a second too soon.  Crux!  The Major had not anticipated for gravity to win so quickly…<BR /><BR />But then as he looked down at distant but fast-approaching ground, the Major realized they were more than high enough.  <BR /><BR />While his mind focused on this, it was not paying attention to Jonathon, and the boy took this distraction to the full of his advantage, breaking free of the Major’s grip.  Startled, the Major repeatedly swung at the boy with his fists, but the boy maneuvered through the freefall expertly and easily dodged.  This frenzy continued as they descended at terminal velocity for several seconds before Jonathon finally retaliated with an uppercut that flipped the Major over and spun him around in the air.  When the Major came to his senses, Jonathon had moved in and had tightly grasped his wrists in an effort to position the Major underneath him.  Realizing what the boy was trying to do, the Major pushed back, and wrestled desperately against the hold of his opponent.  By that point the ground rushing up to meet them began to no longer seem distant at all, and this drove the Major’s instincts into a panic.  With mere moments left before impact, the Major thrust his head into Jonathon’s, making the boy flinch just long enough for the Major to finally turn them both around, and finally succeed in repositioning himself on top of the boy- <BR /><BR />-Three seconds before they hit the ground.<BR /><BR />The sickening thud could be heard for miles around.  <BR /><BR />Some say it could be heard from as far as the opposite edge of the forest.  <BR /><BR />Some protest that it could be heard even farther, as far as all across the Jade Hills.  <BR /><BR />And some say, one way or another, it could be heard from across the entire planet.  <BR /><BR />The Major didn’t hear a thing.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />When he finally came to his senses, the Major’s ears were ringing louder than ten thousand gongs.  His head was pounding so hard, he felt sure it would explode if he tried to move, or even think!  But reluctantly he did.<BR /><BR />As he forced himself to make an attempt at standing up, he felt something underneath his sore arms, something warm…<BR /><BR />Oh no.<BR /><BR />Forgetting the pounding in his head, he desperately moved off the limp body underneath him and moved it into a stable position.  He examined the boy, dreading every moment.  If he had been the one on top and still been knocked out for who knows how long, there was no telling what state Jonathon was in.<BR /><BR />A close examination revealed that the boy was not dead, but definitely unconscious.  The Major gave a sigh of relief, before realizing what that meant in the long term.<BR /><BR />The kids had failed the exercise.<BR /><BR />The Major almost lost it again, but stopped himself.  He didn’t have time for that right now; there was far too much work to be done.<BR /><BR />With exhausted tears streaming down his face, the Major picked up the boy in his arms and carried him to where they needed to be.  There was no delaying it now.  He needed to have a serious talk with all of his trainees.<BR /><BR />The fact that he still called them trainees only redoubled his tears.<BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Hmm, Johnathan is going to turn out to be something!  If the others had been there to back him up, they would definitely have won!<BR /><BR />Poor Major, team training is always hard I know...<BR /><BR />-Goody Vensonite </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, I always did envision Jonathon as the most skilled of all of them. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" />  However, keep in mind that the Major let his guard down because he had already taken care of three of them, and then forgot about the last.  The element of surprise worked in Jonathon's favor for that battle, unlike the three battles preceeding it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />  But yeah, I feel for the Major too.<BR /><BR />So I'm betting everyone is dying to know how the kids will get out of this one.  Well, sad to say, I am NOT done editting the next chapter. <img class="emoticon emoticon-sad" id="sad" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/sad.png" alt="Sad" title="Sad" />  But never fear!  I will be working on it as soon as I finish my Latin homework. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" /><BR /><BR /><BR />~~The Original Major~~

                    <BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD>Chapter 46<BR /><BR /><BR />Three down, one to go.  Disappointed didn’t even begin to describe how the Major felt.  Yes, the exercise was a bit harsh, but he had given them as many advantages as was plausible: a head start, time to prepare, even their faction gear, which according to his analysis was actually significantly higher-grade equipment than standard issue; it seemed A.N.C. not only had the best trainers, but the best gear as well.  Not only that, but the exercise was statistically four to one in their favor.  If they had attacked him together, they would’ve stood a much greater chance.  Hadn’t he told them they would need to show him they could work TOGETHER?!! Wasn’t that THE POINT??!!!!<BR /><BR />The Major needed to calm down, but he just couldn’t.  Praxer’s suicidal attack had gotten him so wound up he could hardly think straight.  Luckily it wasn’t affecting his effectiveness in battle to a great extent, but it sure made it bricking hard to look at the big picture.  <BR /><BR />And now Jonathon was the only one left.  Why the other trainees continued to hold the boy back and take the risks for him, even after the Major had specifically told them not to, the Major would probably never understand.  Well, maybe he could, but still he would pretend not to until the exercise was over.  <BR /><BR />The exercise itself was deceptively simple: the kids had to track down, target, and eliminate a very elusive prey before it got to the edge of the forest.  Simple, until the true nature of the target was revealed.  <BR /><BR />They were hunting the Major.  <BR /><BR />And this time he wasn’t holding back.  <BR /><BR />The Major sighed.  Yes, this may have been expecting too much of them, but from the way they were going down one by one, it was almost as if they weren’t even trying!  He was playing the defense, and they were playing the offense.  Right now they should have had the edge.  But once he made it to the other end of the forest, their roles would switch.  He had hidden a weapons cache there the night before, and most of his tactical equipment was in there: his spare faction-kit fusions, the extra attachments for his Space Marine kit (including all external weapons for it, such as his dual pistols), basically anything that could count as an offensive weapon.  His other gear, such as consumables and items for trade, were back at the camp, just to keep things simple.  Once the Major reached the cache, the odds would no longer be tipped in his opposition’s favor.  <BR /><BR />But his opposition was being a bunch of idiots!!<BR /><BR />Again, the Major realized he had to relax.  If getting to the cache and reversing the roles of hunter and hunted was what it would take to get through to them, so be it.  They weren’t learning the easy way, so he’d have to teach them the hard way.<BR /><BR />So, as he trekked to the end of the forest, the last thing on his mind was wondering where his fourth opponent was.<BR /><BR />But as he emerged from the shadows that faced the weapons cache, the small sound of a drawstring being released in front of him told him that it should have been the first.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />The Major ducked to the side as a volley of arrows whizzed over his head in a blur.  Crux!  He hadn’t bothered to conceal the cache, and now he had walked right into a trap.  Jonathon had been lying in wait at the cache the whole time, and was now shooting at him with an endless stream of arrows.  <BR /><BR />For the first time in the exercise, the Major had been caught off guard.<BR /><BR />He took cover in a thicket to the right of where he had first come out, and did a half-second systems check.  Everything appeared to be okay for the time being.  Jonathon’s ambush had just surprised him was all.<BR /><BR />As he calibrated his armor more thoroughly, he noticed that his systems were starting to heat up, even though they weren’t in use.  Cautiously, he sniffed the air, and peered out through the thicket.  His vision was blocked by a flickering orange wall of- <BR /><BR />Oh Nexus.<BR /><BR />As fast as he could manage, he leapt out of the bush Jon had set ablaze, and rushed over to find less flammable cover.  The arrows from Jonathon’s bow rained down twelve at a time, and his side had no defense but the speed at which he moved.  As the arrows singed his back, he dived into a roll that landed him behind a large stone that would hopefully provide ample cover.  In one motion, he drew each of his twin blasters and charged them one at a time.  Once they were both locked and loaded, he emerged from his cover and before fired wherever he saw movement, not wasting the time it took to look for a target by its identity.  By the time his vision had been able to identify Jonathon, the boy was being blown back by the impact of the attack.  The boy crashed backwards into the weapons cache, causing one or two of the crates to topple over and almost explode.  The Major didn’t give him any time to recover, and was on top of Jonathon before he knew what hit him.  The Major tried to pin Jonathon down by grabbing his wrists, and the boy responded by thrusting forward and delivering a sharp headbutt that sent them both reeling.  The Major recovered first, however, and before the boy could notch another arrow he delivered a swift roundhouse kick that brought the boy down, but more importantly loosened his grip on the bow enough to separate it from its master once and for all.  Undeterred, Jonathon drew his katana, and swept it back and forth, keeping the Major at bay just out of arms reach.  <BR /><BR />With a yell, the Major grabbed a long piece of broken metal from the broken parts of the cache, and started advancing on Jonathon on with an equal weapon.  Just as his makeshift staff was about to break through the boy’s defenses, Jonathon leapt back and charged forward, leaping into the air to deliver a superhuman flying kick that blew the Major back twelve feet.  Before Jonathon could redouble on his opponent, however, the Major activated his jetpack, while he was still face-down in the ground.  Propelled by his awkwardly-angled jetpack, the Major lurched forward horizontally rather than vertically, sending him flying right back into Jonathon with equally superhuman strength.  But instead of letting the momentum carry Jonathon away, he grabbed the boy, and barrel rolled until their momentum corkscrewed and angled them into the air.  This momentum, in coordination with the jetpack, carried them both straight into the sky for quite a ways… before they faltered a second too soon.  Crux!  The Major had not anticipated for gravity to win so quickly…<BR /><BR />But then as he looked down at distant but fast-approaching ground, the Major realized they were more than high enough.  <BR /><BR />While his mind focused on this, it was not paying attention to Jonathon, and the boy took this distraction to the full of his advantage, breaking free of the Major’s grip.  Startled, the Major repeatedly swung at the boy with his fists, but the boy maneuvered through the freefall expertly and easily dodged.  This frenzy continued as they descended at terminal velocity for several seconds before Jonathon finally retaliated with an uppercut that flipped the Major over and spun him around in the air.  When the Major came to his senses, Jonathon had moved in and had tightly grasped his wrists in an effort to position the Major underneath him.  Realizing what the boy was trying to do, the Major pushed back, and wrestled desperately against the hold of his opponent.  By that point the ground rushing up to meet them began to no longer seem distant at all, and this drove the Major’s instincts into a panic.  With mere moments left before impact, the Major thrust his head into Jonathon’s, making the boy flinch just long enough for the Major to finally turn them both around, and finally succeed in repositioning himself on top of the boy- <BR /><BR />-Three seconds before they hit the ground.<BR /><BR />The sickening thud could be heard for miles around.  <BR /><BR />Some say it could be heard from as far as the opposite edge of the forest.  <BR /><BR />Some protest that it could be heard even farther, as far as all across the Jade Hills.  <BR /><BR />And some say, one way or another, it could be heard from across the entire planet.  <BR /><BR />The Major didn’t hear a thing.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />When he finally came to his senses, the Major’s ears were ringing louder than ten thousand gongs.  His head was pounding so hard, he felt sure it would explode if he tried to move, or even think!  But reluctantly he did.<BR /><BR />As he forced himself to make an attempt at standing up, he felt something underneath his sore arms, something warm…<BR /><BR />Oh no.<BR /><BR />Forgetting the pounding in his head, he desperately moved off the limp body underneath him and moved it into a stable position.  He examined the boy, dreading every moment.  If he had been the one on top and still been knocked out for who knows how long, there was no telling what state Jonathon was in.<BR /><BR />A close examination revealed that the boy was not dead, but definitely unconscious.  The Major gave a sigh of relief, before realizing what that meant in the long term.<BR /><BR />The kids had failed the exercise.<BR /><BR />The Major almost lost it again, but stopped himself.  He didn’t have time for that right now; there was far too much work to be done.<BR /><BR />With exhausted tears streaming down his face, the Major picked up the boy in his arms and carried him to where they needed to be.  There was no delaying it now.  He needed to have a serious talk with all of his trainees.<BR /><BR />The fact that he still called them trainees only redoubled his tears.<BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Hmm, Johnathan is going to turn out to be something!  If the others had been there to back him up, they would definitely have won!<BR /><BR />Poor Major, team training is always hard I know...<BR /><BR />-Goody Vensonite </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, I always did envision Jonathon as the most skilled of all of them. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" />  However, keep in mind that the Major let his guard down because he had already taken care of three of them, and then forgot about the last.  The element of surprise worked in Jonathon's favor for that battle, unlike the three battles preceeding it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />  But yeah, I feel for the Major too.<BR /><BR />So I'm betting everyone is dying to know how the kids will get out of this one.

                    <BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD><BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD>Chapter 46<BR /><BR /><BR />Three down, one to go.  Disappointed didn’t even begin to describe how the Major felt.  Yes, the exercise was a bit harsh, but he had given them as many advantages as was plausible: a head start, time to prepare, even their faction gear, which according to his analysis was actually significantly higher-grade equipment than standard issue; it seemed A.N.C. not only had the best trainers, but the best gear as well.  Not only that, but the exercise was statistically four to one in their favor.  If they had attacked him together, they would’ve stood a much greater chance.  Hadn’t he told them they would need to show him they could work TOGETHER?!! Wasn’t that THE POINT??!!!!<BR /><BR />The Major needed to calm down, but he just couldn’t.  Praxer’s suicidal attack had gotten him so wound up he could hardly think straight.  Luckily it wasn’t affecting his effectiveness in battle to a great extent, but it sure made it bricking hard to look at the big picture.  <BR /><BR />And now Jonathon was the only one left.  Why the other trainees continued to hold the boy back and take the risks for him, even after the Major had specifically told them not to, the Major would probably never understand.  Well, maybe he could, but still he would pretend not to until the exercise was over.  <BR /><BR />The exercise itself was deceptively simple: the kids had to track down, target, and eliminate a very elusive prey before it got to the edge of the forest.  Simple, until the true nature of the target was revealed.  <BR /><BR />They were hunting the Major.  <BR /><BR />And this time he wasn’t holding back.  <BR /><BR />The Major sighed.  Yes, this may have been expecting too much of them, but from the way they were going down one by one, it was almost as if they weren’t even trying!  He was playing the defense, and they were playing the offense.  Right now they should have had the edge.  But once he made it to the other end of the forest, their roles would switch.  He had hidden a weapons cache there the night before, and most of his tactical equipment was in there: his spare faction-kit fusions, the extra attachments for his Space Marine kit (including all external weapons for it, such as his dual pistols), basically anything that could count as an offensive weapon.  His other gear, such as consumables and items for trade, were back at the camp, just to keep things simple.  Once the Major reached the cache, the odds would no longer be tipped in his opposition’s favor.  <BR /><BR />But his opposition was being a bunch of idiots!!<BR /><BR />Again, the Major realized he had to relax.  If getting to the cache and reversing the roles of hunter and hunted was what it would take to get through to them, so be it.  They weren’t learning the easy way, so he’d have to teach them the hard way.<BR /><BR />So, as he trekked to the end of the forest, the last thing on his mind was wondering where his fourth opponent was.<BR /><BR />But as he emerged from the shadows that faced the weapons cache, the small sound of a drawstring being released in front of him told him that it should have been the first.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />The Major ducked to the side as a volley of arrows whizzed over his head in a blur.  Crux!  He hadn’t bothered to conceal the cache, and now he had walked right into a trap.  Jonathon had been lying in wait at the cache the whole time, and was now shooting at him with an endless stream of arrows.  <BR /><BR />For the first time in the exercise, the Major had been caught off guard.<BR /><BR />He took cover in a thicket to the right of where he had first come out, and did a half-second systems check.  Everything appeared to be okay for the time being.  Jonathon’s ambush had just surprised him was all.<BR /><BR />As he calibrated his armor more thoroughly, he noticed that his systems were starting to heat up, even though they weren’t in use.  Cautiously, he sniffed the air, and peered out through the thicket.  His vision was blocked by a flickering orange wall of- <BR /><BR />Oh Nexus.<BR /><BR />As fast as he could manage, he leapt out of the bush Jon had set ablaze, and rushed over to find less flammable cover.  The arrows from Jonathon’s bow rained down twelve at a time, and his side had no defense but the speed at which he moved.  As the arrows singed his back, he dived into a roll that landed him behind a large stone that would hopefully provide ample cover.  In one motion, he drew each of his twin blasters and charged them one at a time.  Once they were both locked and loaded, he emerged from his cover and before fired wherever he saw movement, not wasting the time it took to look for a target by its identity.  By the time his vision had been able to identify Jonathon, the boy was being blown back by the impact of the attack.  The boy crashed backwards into the weapons cache, causing one or two of the crates to topple over and almost explode.  The Major didn’t give him any time to recover, and was on top of Jonathon before he knew what hit him.  The Major tried to pin Jonathon down by grabbing his wrists, and the boy responded by thrusting forward and delivering a sharp headbutt that sent them both reeling.  The Major recovered first, however, and before the boy could notch another arrow he delivered a swift roundhouse kick that brought the boy down, but more importantly loosened his grip on the bow enough to separate it from its master once and for all.  Undeterred, Jonathon drew his katana, and swept it back and forth, keeping the Major at bay just out of arms reach.  <BR /><BR />With a yell, the Major grabbed a long piece of broken metal from the broken parts of the cache, and started advancing on Jonathon on with an equal weapon.  Just as his makeshift staff was about to break through the boy’s defenses, Jonathon leapt back and charged forward, leaping into the air to deliver a superhuman flying kick that blew the Major back twelve feet.  Before Jonathon could redouble on his opponent, however, the Major activated his jetpack, while he was still face-down in the ground.  Propelled by his awkwardly-angled jetpack, the Major lurched forward horizontally rather than vertically, sending him flying right back into Jonathon with equally superhuman strength.  But instead of letting the momentum carry Jonathon away, he grabbed the boy, and barrel rolled until their momentum corkscrewed and angled them into the air.  This momentum, in coordination with the jetpack, carried them both straight into the sky for quite a ways… before they faltered a second too soon.  Crux!  The Major had not anticipated for gravity to win so quickly…<BR /><BR />But then as he looked down at distant but fast-approaching ground, the Major realized they were more than high enough.  <BR /><BR />While his mind focused on this, it was not paying attention to Jonathon, and the boy took this distraction to the full of his advantage, breaking free of the Major’s grip.  Startled, the Major repeatedly swung at the boy with his fists, but the boy maneuvered through the freefall expertly and easily dodged.  This frenzy continued as they descended at terminal velocity for several seconds before Jonathon finally retaliated with an uppercut that flipped the Major over and spun him around in the air.  When the Major came to his senses, Jonathon had moved in and had tightly grasped his wrists in an effort to position the Major underneath him.  Realizing what the boy was trying to do, the Major pushed back, and wrestled desperately against the hold of his opponent.  By that point the ground rushing up to meet them began to no longer seem distant at all, and this drove the Major’s instincts into a panic.  With mere moments left before impact, the Major thrust his head into Jonathon’s, making the boy flinch just long enough for the Major to finally turn them both around, and finally succeed in repositioning himself on top of the boy- <BR /><BR />-Three seconds before they hit the ground.<BR /><BR />The sickening thud could be heard for miles around.  <BR /><BR />Some say it could be heard from as far as the opposite edge of the forest.  <BR /><BR />Some protest that it could be heard even farther, as far as all across the Jade Hills.  <BR /><BR />And some say, one way or another, it could be heard from across the entire planet.  <BR /><BR />The Major didn’t hear a thing.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />When he finally came to his senses, the Major’s ears were ringing louder than ten thousand gongs.  His head was pounding so hard, he felt sure it would explode if he tried to move, or even think!  But reluctantly he did.<BR /><BR />As he forced himself to make an attempt at standing up, he felt something underneath his sore arms, something warm…<BR /><BR />Oh no.<BR /><BR />Forgetting the pounding in his head, he desperately moved off the limp body underneath him and moved it into a stable position.  He examined the boy, dreading every moment.  If he had been the one on top and still been knocked out for who knows how long, there was no telling what state Jonathon was in.<BR /><BR />A close examination revealed that the boy was not dead, but definitely unconscious.  The Major gave a sigh of relief, before realizing what that meant in the long term.<BR /><BR />The kids had failed the exercise.<BR /><BR />The Major almost lost it again, but stopped himself.  He didn’t have time for that right now; there was far too much work to be done.<BR /><BR />With exhausted tears streaming down his face, the Major picked up the boy in his arms and carried him to where they needed to be.  There was no delaying it now.  He needed to have a serious talk with all of his trainees.<BR /><BR />The fact that he still called them trainees only redoubled his tears.<BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Hmm, Johnathan is going to turn out to be something!  If the others had been there to back him up, they would definitely have won!<BR /><BR />Poor Major, team training is always hard I know...<BR /><BR />-Goody Vensonite </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, I always did envision Jonathon as the most skilled of all of them. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" />  However, keep in mind that the Major let his guard down because he had already taken care of three of them, and then forgot about the last.  The element of surprise worked in Jonathon's favor for that battle, unlike the three battles preceeding it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />  But yeah, I feel for the Major too.<BR /><BR />So I'm betting everyone is dying to know how the kids will get out of this one.  Well, sad to say, I am NOT done editting the next chapter. <img class="emoticon emoticon-sad" id="sad" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/sad.png" alt="Sad" title="Sad" />  But never fear!  I will be working on it as soon as I finish my Latin homework. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" /><BR /><BR /><BR />~~The Original Major~~ </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Ouch, Latin. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> En pluribus unum. (spelling) what does that mean? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> I have no idea. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />-Sharpie: daredevil of lightning <BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />"E Pluribus Unum" means, "One From Many" or, as some might say, "From Many, One".  "E" is the contracted form of the preposition "Ex" meaning "from out of".  "Unum" is one, "Pluribus" is many. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />I actually don't mind Latin though.  It's fun. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />Ok, so, I've finished editting the first half of what I originally meant to be one chapter, but now it looks like this might turn out to be two. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />  Problem is, I really don't WANT it to be two, as there is no way I can really split it up without somehow disrupting the flow. <img class="emoticon emoticon-sad" id="sad" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/sad.png" alt="Sad" title="Sad" /> If I try posting it as two separate chapters, there's a good chance the tension built up in the first one will be lost in transition before you get into the second, which I believe cuts their overall effectiveness down to less than half, maybe even a third.  My rule with writing is to trust the flow and avoid going against it as much as possible, but there is really no way I can split up this chapter without disrupting the flow in some way. <BR /><BR />So basically, these are my options here:<BR /><BR />a) Try posting it as two separate chapters, with a 104% chance of greatly disrupting the flow in the proccess<BR /><BR />b) Try posting it as one chapter, after spending even more time editting it in an effort to shorten it somewhat, and, using the quote button if necessary.<BR /><BR />c) Try posting it as one chapter without shortening it, with a greater chance of needing to use the quote button.<BR /><BR />Of course, I still need to finish doing the second half of the first edits before I can continue with that... <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />

Disappointed didn’t even begin to describe how the Major felt.  Yes, the exercise was a bit harsh, but he had given them as many advantages as was plausible: a head start, time to prepare, even their faction gear, which according to his analysis was actually significantly higher-grade equipment than standard issue; it seemed A.N.C. not only had the best trainers, but the best gear as well.  Not only that, but the exercise was statistically four to one in their favor.  If they had attacked him together, they would’ve stood a much greater chance.  Hadn’t he told them they would need to show him they could work TOGETHER?!! Wasn’t that THE POINT??!!!!<BR /><BR />The Major needed to calm down, but he just couldn’t.  Praxer’s suicidal attack had gotten him so wound up he could hardly think straight.  Luckily it wasn’t affecting his effectiveness in battle to a great extent, but it sure made it bricking hard to look at the big picture.  <BR /><BR />And now Jonathon was the only one left.  Why the other trainees continued to hold the boy back and take the risks for him, even after the Major had specifically told them not to, the Major would probably never understand.  Well, maybe he could, but still he would pretend not to until the exercise was over.  <BR /><BR />The exercise itself was deceptively simple: the kids had to track down, target, and eliminate a very elusive prey before it got to the edge of the forest.  Simple, until the true nature of the target was revealed.  <BR /><BR />They were hunting the Major.  <BR /><BR />And this time he wasn’t holding back.  <BR /><BR />The Major sighed.  Yes, this may have been expecting too much of them, but from the way they were going down one by one, it was almost as if they weren’t even trying!  He was playing the defense, and they were playing the offense.  Right now they should have had the edge.  But once he made it to the other end of the forest, their roles would switch.  He had hidden a weapons cache there the night before, and most of his tactical equipment was in there: his spare faction-kit fusions, the extra attachments for his Space Marine kit (including all external weapons for it, such as his dual pistols), basically anything that could count as an offensive weapon.  His other gear, such as consumables and items for trade, were back at the camp, just to keep things simple.  Once the Major reached the cache, the odds would no longer be tipped in his opposition’s favor.  <BR /><BR />But his opposition was being a bunch of idiots!!<BR /><BR />Again, the Major realized he had to relax.  If getting to the cache and reversing the roles of hunter and hunted was what it would take to get through to them, so be it.  They weren’t learning the easy way, so he’d have to teach them the hard way.<BR /><BR />So, as he trekked to the end of the forest, the last thing on his mind was wondering where his fourth opponent was.<BR /><BR />But as he emerged from the shadows that faced the weapons cache, the small sound of a drawstring being released in front of him told him that it should have been the first.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />The Major ducked to the side as a volley of arrows whizzed over his head in a blur.  Crux!  He hadn’t bothered to conceal the cache, and now he had walked right into a trap.  Jonathon had been lying in wait at the cache the whole time, and was now shooting at him with an endless stream of arrows.  <BR /><BR />For the first time in the exercise, the Major had been caught off guard.<BR /><BR />He took cover in a thicket to the right of where he had first come out, and did a half-second systems check.  Everything appeared to be okay for the time being.  Jonathon’s ambush had just surprised him was all.<BR /><BR />As he calibrated his armor more thoroughly, he noticed that his systems were starting to heat up, even though they weren’t in use.  Cautiously, he sniffed the air, and peered out through the thicket.  His vision was blocked by a flickering orange wall of- <BR /><BR />Oh Nexus.<BR /><BR />As fast as he could manage, he leapt out of the bush Jon had set ablaze, and rushed over to find less flammable cover.  The arrows from Jonathon’s bow rained down twelve at a time, and his side had no defense but the speed at which he moved.  As the arrows singed his back, he dived into a roll that landed him behind a large stone that would hopefully provide ample cover.  In one motion, he drew each of his twin blasters and charged them one at a time.  Once they were both locked and loaded, he emerged from his cover and before fired wherever he saw movement, not wasting the time it took to look for a target by its identity.  By the time his vision had been able to identify Jonathon, the boy was being blown back by the impact of the attack.  The boy crashed backwards into the weapons cache, causing one or two of the crates to topple over and almost explode.  The Major didn’t give him any time to recover, and was on top of Jonathon before he knew what hit him.  The Major tried to pin Jonathon down by grabbing his wrists, and the boy responded by thrusting forward and delivering a sharp headbutt that sent them both reeling.  The Major recovered first, however, and before the boy could notch another arrow he delivered a swift roundhouse kick that brought the boy down, but more importantly loosened his grip on the bow enough to separate it from its master once and for all.  Undeterred, Jonathon drew his katana, and swept it back and forth, keeping the Major at bay just out of arms reach.  <BR /><BR />With a yell, the Major grabbed a long piece of broken metal from the broken parts of the cache, and started advancing on Jonathon on with an equal weapon.  Just as his makeshift staff was about to break through the boy’s defenses, Jonathon leapt back and charged forward, leaping into the air to deliver a superhuman flying kick that blew the Major back twelve feet.  Before Jonathon could redouble on his opponent, however, the Major activated his jetpack, while he was still face-down in the ground.  Propelled by his awkwardly-angled jetpack, the Major lurched forward horizontally rather than vertically, sending him flying right back into Jonathon with equally superhuman strength.  But instead of letting the momentum carry Jonathon away, he grabbed the boy, and barrel rolled until their momentum corkscrewed and angled them into the air.  This momentum, in coordination with the jetpack, carried them both straight into the sky for quite a ways… before they faltered a second too soon.  Crux!  The Major had not anticipated for gravity to win so quickly…<BR /><BR />But then as he looked down at distant but fast-approaching ground, the Major realized they were more than high enough.  <BR /><BR />While his mind focused on this, it was not paying attention to Jonathon, and the boy took this distraction to the full of his advantage, breaking free of the Major’s grip.  Startled, the Major repeatedly swung at the boy with his fists, but the boy maneuvered through the freefall expertly and easily dodged.  This frenzy continued as they descended at terminal velocity for several seconds before Jonathon finally retaliated with an uppercut that flipped the Major over and spun him around in the air.  When the Major came to his senses, Jonathon had moved in and had tightly grasped his wrists in an effort to position the Major underneath him.  Realizing what the boy was trying to do, the Major pushed back, and wrestled desperately against the hold of his opponent.  By that point the ground rushing up to meet them began to no longer seem distant at all, and this drove the Major’s instincts into a panic.  With mere moments left before impact, the Major thrust his head into Jonathon’s, making the boy flinch just long enough for the Major to finally turn them both around, and finally succeed in repositioning himself on top of the boy- <BR /><BR />-Three seconds before they hit the ground.<BR /><BR />The sickening thud could be heard for miles around.  <BR /><BR />Some say it could be heard from as far as the opposite edge of the forest.  <BR /><BR />Some protest that it could be heard even farther, as far as all across the Jade Hills.  <BR /><BR />And some say, one way or another, it could be heard from across the entire planet.  <BR /><BR />The Major didn’t hear a thing.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />When he finally came to his senses, the Major’s ears were ringing louder than ten thousand gongs.  His head was pounding so hard, he felt sure it would explode if he tried to move, or even think!  But reluctantly he did.<BR /><BR />As he forced himself to make an attempt at standing up, he felt something underneath his sore arms, something warm…<BR /><BR />Oh no.<BR /><BR />Forgetting the pounding in his head, he desperately moved off the limp body underneath him and moved it into a stable position.  He examined the boy, dreading every moment.  If he had been the one on top and still been knocked out for who knows how long, there was no telling what state Jonathon was in.<BR /><BR />A close examination revealed that the boy was not dead, but definitely unconscious.  The Major gave a sigh of relief, before realizing what that meant in the long term.<BR /><BR />The kids had failed the exercise.<BR /><BR />The Major almost lost it again, but stopped himself.  He didn’t have time for that right now; there was far too much work to be done.<BR /><BR />With exhausted tears streaming down his face, the Major picked up the boy in his arms and carried him to where they needed to be.  There was no delaying it now.  He needed to have a serious talk with all of his trainees.<BR /><BR />The fact that he still called them trainees only redoubled his tears.<BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Hmm, Johnathan is going to turn out to be something!  If the others had been there to back him up, they would definitely have won!<BR /><BR />Poor Major, team training is always hard I know...<BR /><BR />-Goody Vensonite </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, I always did envision Jonathon as the most skilled of all of them. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" />  However, keep in mind that the Major let his guard down because he had already taken care of three of them, and then forgot about the last.  The element of surprise worked in Jonathon's favor for that battle, unlike the three battles preceeding it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />  But yeah, I feel for the Major too.<BR /><BR />So I'm betting everyone is dying to know how the kids will get out of this one.  Well, sad to say, I am NOT done editting the next chapter. <img class="emoticon emoticon-sad" id="sad" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/sad.png" alt="Sad" title="Sad" />  But never fear!  I will be working on it as soon as I finish my Latin homework. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" /><BR /><BR /><BR />~~The Original Major~~ </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Ouch, Latin. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> En pluribus unum. (spelling) what does that mean? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> I have no idea. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />-Sharpie: daredevil of lightning <BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />"E Pluribus Unum" means, "One From Many" or, as some might say, "From Many, One".  "E" is the contracted form of the preposition "Ex" meaning "from out of".  "Unum" is one, "Pluribus" is many. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />I actually don't mind Latin though.  It's fun. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />Ok, so, I've finished editting the first half of what I originally meant to be one chapter, but now it looks like this might turn out to be two. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />  Problem is, I really don't WANT it to be two, as there is no way I can really split it up without somehow disrupting the flow. <img class="emoticon emoticon-sad" id="sad" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/sad.png" alt="Sad" title="Sad" /> If I try posting it as two separate chapters, there's a good chance the tension built up in the first one will be lost in transition before you get into the second, which I believe cuts their overall effectiveness down to less than half, maybe even a third.  My rule with writing is to trust the flow and avoid going against it as much as possible, but there is really no way I can split up this chapter without disrupting the flow in some way. <BR /><BR />So basically, these are my options here:<BR /><BR />a) Try posting it as two separate chapters, with a 104% chance of greatly disrupting the flow in the proccess<BR /><BR />b) Try posting it as one chapter, after spending even more time editting it in an effort to shorten it somewhat, and, using the quote button if necessary.<BR /><BR />c) Try posting it as one chapter without shortening it, with a greater chance of needing to use the quote button.<BR /><BR />Of course, I still need to finish doing the second half of the first edits before I can continue with that... <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />c).

Disappointed didn’t even begin to describe how the Major felt.  Yes, the exercise was a bit harsh, but he had given them as many advantages as was plausible: a head start, time to prepare, even their faction gear, which according to his analysis was actually significantly higher-grade equipment than standard issue; it seemed A.N.C. not only had the best trainers, but the best gear as well.  Not only that, but the exercise was statistically four to one in their favor.  If they had attacked him together, they would’ve stood a much greater chance.  Hadn’t he told them they would need to show him they could work TOGETHER?!! Wasn’t that THE POINT??!!!!<BR /><BR />The Major needed to calm down, but he just couldn’t.  Praxer’s suicidal attack had gotten him so wound up he could hardly think straight.  Luckily it wasn’t affecting his effectiveness in battle to a great extent, but it sure made it bricking hard to look at the big picture.  <BR /><BR />And now Jonathon was the only one left.  Why the other trainees continued to hold the boy back and take the risks for him, even after the Major had specifically told them not to, the Major would probably never understand.  Well, maybe he could, but still he would pretend not to until the exercise was over.  <BR /><BR />The exercise itself was deceptively simple: the kids had to track down, target, and eliminate a very elusive prey before it got to the edge of the forest.  Simple, until the true nature of the target was revealed.  <BR /><BR />They were hunting the Major.  <BR /><BR />And this time he wasn’t holding back.  <BR /><BR />The Major sighed.  Yes, this may have been expecting too much of them, but from the way they were going down one by one, it was almost as if they weren’t even trying!  He was playing the defense, and they were playing the offense.  Right now they should have had the edge.  But once he made it to the other end of the forest, their roles would switch.  He had hidden a weapons cache there the night before, and most of his tactical equipment was in there: his spare faction-kit fusions, the extra attachments for his Space Marine kit (including all external weapons for it, such as his dual pistols), basically anything that could count as an offensive weapon.  His other gear, such as consumables and items for trade, were back at the camp, just to keep things simple.  Once the Major reached the cache, the odds would no longer be tipped in his opposition’s favor.  <BR /><BR />But his opposition was being a bunch of idiots!!<BR /><BR />Again, the Major realized he had to relax.  If getting to the cache and reversing the roles of hunter and hunted was what it would take to get through to them, so be it.  They weren’t learning the easy way, so he’d have to teach them the hard way.<BR /><BR />So, as he trekked to the end of the forest, the last thing on his mind was wondering where his fourth opponent was.<BR /><BR />But as he emerged from the shadows that faced the weapons cache, the small sound of a drawstring being released in front of him told him that it should have been the first.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />The Major ducked to the side as a volley of arrows whizzed over his head in a blur.  Crux!  He hadn’t bothered to conceal the cache, and now he had walked right into a trap.  Jonathon had been lying in wait at the cache the whole time, and was now shooting at him with an endless stream of arrows.  <BR /><BR />For the first time in the exercise, the Major had been caught off guard.<BR /><BR />He took cover in a thicket to the right of where he had first come out, and did a half-second systems check.  Everything appeared to be okay for the time being.  Jonathon’s ambush had just surprised him was all.<BR /><BR />As he calibrated his armor more thoroughly, he noticed that his systems were starting to heat up, even though they weren’t in use.  Cautiously, he sniffed the air, and peered out through the thicket.  His vision was blocked by a flickering orange wall of- <BR /><BR />Oh Nexus.<BR /><BR />As fast as he could manage, he leapt out of the bush Jon had set ablaze, and rushed over to find less flammable cover.  The arrows from Jonathon’s bow rained down twelve at a time, and his side had no defense but the speed at which he moved.  As the arrows singed his back, he dived into a roll that landed him behind a large stone that would hopefully provide ample cover.  In one motion, he drew each of his twin blasters and charged them one at a time.  Once they were both locked and loaded, he emerged from his cover and before fired wherever he saw movement, not wasting the time it took to look for a target by its identity.  By the time his vision had been able to identify Jonathon, the boy was being blown back by the impact of the attack.  The boy crashed backwards into the weapons cache, causing one or two of the crates to topple over and almost explode.  The Major didn’t give him any time to recover, and was on top of Jonathon before he knew what hit him.  The Major tried to pin Jonathon down by grabbing his wrists, and the boy responded by thrusting forward and delivering a sharp headbutt that sent them both reeling.  The Major recovered first, however, and before the boy could notch another arrow he delivered a swift roundhouse kick that brought the boy down, but more importantly loosened his grip on the bow enough to separate it from its master once and for all.  Undeterred, Jonathon drew his katana, and swept it back and forth, keeping the Major at bay just out of arms reach.  <BR /><BR />With a yell, the Major grabbed a long piece of broken metal from the broken parts of the cache, and started advancing on Jonathon on with an equal weapon.  Just as his makeshift staff was about to break through the boy’s defenses, Jonathon leapt back and charged forward, leaping into the air to deliver a superhuman flying kick that blew the Major back twelve feet.  Before Jonathon could redouble on his opponent, however, the Major activated his jetpack, while he was still face-down in the ground.  Propelled by his awkwardly-angled jetpack, the Major lurched forward horizontally rather than vertically, sending him flying right back into Jonathon with equally superhuman strength.  But instead of letting the momentum carry Jonathon away, he grabbed the boy, and barrel rolled until their momentum corkscrewed and angled them into the air.  This momentum, in coordination with the jetpack, carried them both straight into the sky for quite a ways… before they faltered a second too soon.  Crux!  The Major had not anticipated for gravity to win so quickly…<BR /><BR />But then as he looked down at distant but fast-approaching ground, the Major realized they were more than high enough.  <BR /><BR />While his mind focused on this, it was not paying attention to Jonathon, and the boy took this distraction to the full of his advantage, breaking free of the Major’s grip.  Startled, the Major repeatedly swung at the boy with his fists, but the boy maneuvered through the freefall expertly and easily dodged.  This frenzy continued as they descended at terminal velocity for several seconds before Jonathon finally retaliated with an uppercut that flipped the Major over and spun him around in the air.  When the Major came to his senses, Jonathon had moved in and had tightly grasped his wrists in an effort to position the Major underneath him.  Realizing what the boy was trying to do, the Major pushed back, and wrestled desperately against the hold of his opponent.  By that point the ground rushing up to meet them began to no longer seem distant at all, and this drove the Major’s instincts into a panic.  With mere moments left before impact, the Major thrust his head into Jonathon’s, making the boy flinch just long enough for the Major to finally turn them both around, and finally succeed in repositioning himself on top of the boy- <BR /><BR />-Three seconds before they hit the ground.<BR /><BR />The sickening thud could be heard for miles around.  <BR /><BR />Some say it could be heard from as far as the opposite edge of the forest.  <BR /><BR />Some protest that it could be heard even farther, as far as all across the Jade Hills.  <BR /><BR />And some say, one way or another, it could be heard from across the entire planet.  <BR /><BR />The Major didn’t hear a thing.<BR /><BR />**************************************************<wbr />********************************************<BR /><BR />When he finally came to his senses, the Major’s ears were ringing louder than ten thousand gongs.  His head was pounding so hard, he felt sure it would explode if he tried to move, or even think!  But reluctantly he did.<BR /><BR />As he forced himself to make an attempt at standing up, he felt something underneath his sore arms, something warm…<BR /><BR />Oh no.<BR /><BR />Forgetting the pounding in his head, he desperately moved off the limp body underneath him and moved it into a stable position.  He examined the boy, dreading every moment.  If he had been the one on top and still been knocked out for who knows how long, there was no telling what state Jonathon was in.<BR /><BR />A close examination revealed that the boy was not dead, but definitely unconscious.  The Major gave a sigh of relief, before realizing what that meant in the long term.<BR /><BR />The kids had failed the exercise.<BR /><BR />The Major almost lost it again, but stopped himself.  He didn’t have time for that right now; there was far too much work to be done.<BR /><BR />With exhausted tears streaming down his face, the Major picked up the boy in his arms and carried him to where they needed to be.  There was no delaying it now.  He needed to have a serious talk with all of his trainees.<BR /><BR />The fact that he still called them trainees only redoubled his tears.<BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Hmm, Johnathan is going to turn out to be something!  If the others had been there to back him up, they would definitely have won!<BR /><BR />Poor Major, team training is always hard I know...<BR /><BR />-Goody Vensonite </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, I always did envision Jonathon as the most skilled of all of them. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" />  However, keep in mind that the Major let his guard down because he had already taken care of three of them, and then forgot about the last.  The element of surprise worked in Jonathon's favor for that battle, unlike the three battles preceeding it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />  But yeah, I feel for the Major too.<BR /><BR />So I'm betting everyone is dying to know how the kids will get out of this one.  Well, sad to say, I am NOT done editting the next chapter. <img class="emoticon emoticon-sad" id="sad" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/sad.png" alt="Sad" title="Sad" />  But never fear!  I will be working on it as soon as I finish my Latin homework. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" /><BR /><BR /><BR />~~The Original Major~~ </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Ouch, Latin. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> En pluribus unum. (spelling) what does that mean? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> I have no idea. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />-Sharpie: daredevil of lightning <BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />"E Pluribus Unum" means, "One From Many" or, as some might say, "From Many, One".  "E" is the contracted form of the preposition "Ex" meaning "from out of".  "Unum" is one, "Pluribus" is many. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />I actually don't mind Latin though.  It's fun. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />Ok, so, I've finished editting the first half of what I originally meant to be one chapter, but now it looks like this might turn out to be two. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />  Problem is, I really don't WANT it to be two, as there is no way I can really split it up without somehow disrupting the flow. <img class="emoticon emoticon-sad" id="sad" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/sad.png" alt="Sad" title="Sad" /> If I try posting it as two separate chapters, there's a good chance the tension built up in the first one will be lost in transition before you get into the second, which I believe cuts their overall effectiveness down to less than half, maybe even a third.  My rule with writing is to trust the flow and avoid going against it as much as possible, but there is really no way I can split up this chapter without disrupting the flow in some way. <BR /><BR />So basically, these are my options here:<BR /><BR />a) Try posting it as two separate chapters, with a 104% chance of greatly disrupting the flow in the proccess<BR /><BR />b) Try posting it as one chapter, after spending even more time editting it in an effort to shorten it somewhat, and, using the quote button if necessary.<BR /><BR />c) Try posting it as one chapter without shortening it, with a greater chance of needing to use the quote button.<BR /><BR />Of course, I still need to finish doing the second half of the first edits before I can continue with that... <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />c).

                    Okay, so as for this next chapter (I'm not going t quote that huge thing again <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />) I have finished going through one editting run.  Thing is, I always feel that the longer chapters need the most edits, and I think this may be my longest chapter yet.  This is probably because it [SPOILER ALERT] begins as just a conversation which then transitions into an action sequence.  The logical place to split it, which I won't, would be at that transition point, but I can't exactly do that as the conversation's purpose is to build up the tension for the action sequence.  So basically, this more or less TWO chapters for the price of one, because I can't get it to flow properly as more than one. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />  But right now I need to get to bed, so hopefully the chapter will be up tomorrow.  <BR /><BR /><BR />"Good night, good night, parting is such sweet sorrow... that I feel a compulsory need to quote Shakespeare to express it adequately." <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />~~The Original Major~~

                    Hello again, readers!  Today I will be out for most of the afternoon, so I probably won't be able to write much.  But I have a confession to make: I haven't been working on this nearly as much as I should. <img class="emoticon emoticon-sad" id="sad" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/sad.png" alt="Sad" title="Sad" />  There's just so much I want to do this summer, you know? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />  Not that that's an excuse. <img class="emoticon emoticon-sad" id="sad" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/sad.png" alt="Sad" title="Sad" />  <BR /><BR />I noticed that if I try to focus on ONE thing for several days in a row, it's just doesn't get done, so here's my plan: I've decided that I will try to work on Crux Origins EVERY OTHER DAY at least.  This way I don't get overstimulated from too much writing, and the writing still gets done. <img class="emoticon emoticon-happy" id="happy" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/happy.png" alt="Happy" title="Happy" />  <BR /><BR />One last note: I will also be displaying items at Brickfair on the first weekend of August, if anyone is going to go see that. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" />  But first I need to work on stuff to display.... <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />So there you have it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" />  I'll work on finishing the next chapter today if I can, tomorrow if I can't. <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" id="smile" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/smile.png" alt="Smile" title="Smile" />  Hang in there!<BR /><BR />~~The Original Major~~
