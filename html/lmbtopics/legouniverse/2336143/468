You have a problem with people giving others damage but no problem with people doing moves after your own but supposedly before yours? What?<BR /><BR />Um. You have a problem with radiation?

I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR />2.

So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said.

Perfectly logical."<BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things?

Oooookay. <BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot. The population of the planet would most likely perish from the temperature changes, and the ecosystem of the planet would br ruined .<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, pretty much. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=-</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Agreed, maybe I could be LURP's first OP Lawyer?<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />How about you do that? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> You seem rather unbaised, unlike myself. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Infact if you were the head of that "LU Court" I would probably start to respect it.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />There is a court?

Krill took over as leader since Wish doesn't have as much time anymore, but he's still around somtimes.<BR />2. We're allied with The Swords of Light, which is Hovawart's group, but since he (Along with LEGO fan, and Meedled.) Are very inactive, BuckyKat is currently the only leader there, we're also allied with The Maelstrom which I am second in command of, and apparently we're also allies of one of Fire-Types HQs, The Confederacy, or something like that, and we all meet at The Dark Ring Empire (DRE.)<BR />3. We have these guys called the "rebellion" fighting us along with the Nexus Force, they are rather aubsurd at most times and made LU roleplay much less fun than it used to be, the worst of them would be Airdude500, he does, well a lot of annoying stuff, it would take way to long to just list them, after a few days to a week of his posts, you know what I mean, oh, I got it, to sum it up, he's worse than Mastergoalie.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Allow me to add something to three:<BR /><BR />So they're so bad and annoying but we still haven't come up with a reason why they're more OP than us<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Oh yeah, they also can't state any good reasons why WE are OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Unlike this gaggle of reasons I have here and have stated before.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1.

You critisize Alcubierres, even though you have and used Void portals.<BR />You also critisized Alcubierres right after you created black holes, with no context as I recall.<BR />You also said FELs were weapons of mass destruction, only a short while after using your Xindi superweapon. <BR /><BR />I can also name dozens of other hypocritical things. <BR /><BR />2. You have a problem with people giving others damage but no problem with people doing moves after your own but supposedly before yours? What?<BR /><BR />Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said.

I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR />2. If the defender thinks they should be able to do something different than the attacker stated, they normally say somthing.<BR /><BR /><BR />"Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?"<BR />I should have said Gamma rays instead of radiation, but why I won't accept them? You never gave me a simple explenation on why I should. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> <BR /><BR /><BR />"As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical."<BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!"<BR />I said I had problems with stargate things? I said I had problems with that battery, nothing else, (Yet..) because that battery isn't actually possible to create. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Not that I've seen atleast.<BR /> <BR /><BR />"I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me." <BR />Who said I was just blaming you? I said I was listing "THEY," as in everyone who called me OP, you were just talking about me, not my allies, I however, was talking about everybody who called me OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />I noticed you said nothing about m calling out Bane, does that meaan you agree with me after stating just that? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Maybe I should just try to keep it simple more often. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. There are atomic measurements. I ain't sure what ya mean.<BR /><BR />2. Well, Krill uses them.

Oooookay. <BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot. The population of the planet would most likely perish from the temperature changes, and the ecosystem of the planet would br ruined .<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yep. I agree 100% <BR /><BR />I think Bane's planet is lava, so I don't think you'd be ruining any landscapes<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />-puts on suit and tie, combs hair-<BR /><BR />"...Therefore, the court finds that 'planet moving' in the form illustrated by Bane to be gulity of the charges of being Over Powered..."<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />HIRED!

Krill took over as leader since Wish doesn't have as much time anymore, but he's still around somtimes.<BR />2. We're allied with The Swords of Light, which is Hovawart's group, but since he (Along with LEGO fan, and Meedled.) Are very inactive, BuckyKat is currently the only leader there, we're also allied with The Maelstrom which I am second in command of, and apparently we're also allies of one of Fire-Types HQs, The Confederacy, or something like that, and we all meet at The Dark Ring Empire (DRE.)<BR />3. We have these guys called the "rebellion" fighting us along with the Nexus Force, they are rather aubsurd at most times and made LU roleplay much less fun than it used to be, the worst of them would be Airdude500, he does, well a lot of annoying stuff, it would take way to long to just list them, after a few days to a week of his posts, you know what I mean, oh, I got it, to sum it up, he's worse than Mastergoalie.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Allow me to add something to three:<BR /><BR />So they're so bad and annoying but we still haven't come up with a reason why they're more OP than us<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Oh yeah, they also can't state any good reasons why WE are OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Unlike this gaggle of reasons I have here and have stated before.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1.

You critisize Alcubierres, even though you have and used Void portals.<BR />You also critisized Alcubierres right after you created black holes, with no context as I recall.<BR />You also said FELs were weapons of mass destruction, only a short while after using your Xindi superweapon. <BR /><BR />I can also name dozens of other hypocritical things. <BR /><BR />2. You have a problem with people giving others damage but no problem with people doing moves after your own but supposedly before yours? What?<BR /><BR />Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?<BR /><BR />As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure.

I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR />2. If the defender thinks they should be able to do something different than the attacker stated, they normally say somthing.<BR /><BR /><BR />"Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?"<BR />I should have said Gamma rays instead of radiation, but why I won't accept them? You never gave me a simple explenation on why I should. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> <BR /><BR /><BR />"As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical."<BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!"<BR />I said I had problems with stargate things? I said I had problems with that battery, nothing else, (Yet..) because that battery isn't actually possible to create. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Not that I've seen atleast.<BR /> <BR /><BR />"I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me." <BR />Who said I was just blaming you? I said I was listing "THEY," as in everyone who called me OP, you were just talking about me, not my allies, I however, was talking about everybody who called me OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />I noticed you said nothing about m calling out Bane, does that meaan you agree with me after stating just that? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Maybe I should just try to keep it simple more often. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. There are atomic measurements. I ain't sure what ya mean.<BR /><BR />2. Well, Krill uses them.

Oooookay. <BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Who the heck is Stargate? Batteries taking energies from other dimensions? What are you talking about!?! </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />It's tech from a tv show.

My own ship is in the front. The stronger the ship, the closer it is to the front. We contact you* Lower your shields and leave the sector. Resistance would be futile. *A few electric space eels are released from cages. The ship who did it tries to escape but is disintegrated. The ARA ships are far from it but it sees the Void ships* </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You made a move for me, I never had my ships flee, BAN HAMMA'ED.<BR /><BR />2. electric space eels, what? Destroying a ship just like that? Sounds very OP.<BR /><BR />3. About your other post concerning "Dreader Missles" You're welcome to leave if you don't like it, because I don't particularly like your tone, as well as it being very unrealistic.<BR /><BR />Also the main Void fleet is not here, just civilians on our planets.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. I never made a move with your ships. I disapprove of that method.<BR />2. Oh. So you don't want a giant eel destroying one of my ships? Okay. I still have the ship if thats what you want.<BR />3. You didn't hear my tone. The caps was to get your attention. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You said one of my ships tryed to escape then was vaporised.<BR /><BR />2. I can't understand you.<BR /><BR />3. You were raging by CAPPING ALL WORDS, thats tone to me, and I don't like it, so I'm asking you to leave.<BR /><BR />4. Shrink rays are unlogical, and The Vanguard is hidden, respecting any of your move now, I am not, because you still don't know what it means to play fair.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1: Are you blind? Wow. Talk about people not listening. I said the ship that released the eels from the cages was vaporized.<BR /><BR />2: One of my ships released the eels. It tried to escape. It was vaporized. I was trying to make it fair by they could destroy our ships too. But if thats OP, what do you call fair?<BR /><BR />3: If that's rage to you, I apologize. You, along with many other people, don't read the most important stuff so I have to get your attention for it in caps.<BR /><BR />4: The shrink ray was random, meaning, nobody did it. It was actually not OP. If you don't want the vanguard to be more maneuverable while not losing any of it's power, *A enlarge ray hits the vanguard*  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />I would like to say a couple of things:<BR /><BR />1. There is much dishonorable talk going on here. I think that for certain the ARA can be more kind<img class="emoticon emoticon-confused" id="confused" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/confused.png" alt="Confused" title="Confused" /> <BR /><BR />2. Krill asked for the Void HQ not be attacked. Unless Wisholen is active now, no one should be attacking. <BR /><BR />3. The Shrink Ray is totally OP. <BR /><BR />4. I think Soranos is completely right in what he said, except for that the Vanguard is hidden. The Void fleet was at the Dark Ring Empire base, instead of in the Vanguard, so unless the Vanguard was at the recent DRE battle, 2,000 cruisers emerged from a giant metal monster of a space station<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> I would say that would allow most any HQ to detect it easily. Unless of course it cloaked and moved or something.   </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1: Yes I probably could if RP wasn't driving me crazy. Nobody listens to my posts. Don't pretend you listen to the maturity of the posts that I address to you. Also having no decent troops on my HQ drives me crazy too.<BR /><BR />2: I didn't see that.<BR /><BR />3: I didn't do it. Random means random and nobody did it. Shrink rays don't do anything but shrink something. They don't shrink the power, just the mass. It actually HELPED them but I knew they were gonna say it was OP so now their ship is back to being as maneuverable as a large planet.<BR /><BR />Bye! Have fun. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. I'm sorry about that. I mean, it just takes time. No one is doing it on purpose. There's no hidden topic or jammers that says to ignore Mistika. I do listen to your posts Mistika... I don't know what you're talking about. You can have decent troops, but no one is going to listen to having giant illogical weapons or massive fleets. <BR /><BR />2. Okay. <BR /><BR />3. Random or otherwise, it is still OP!! Describe to me how you would shrink ray something, and then I might possibly change my mind, assuming there were months of RL time behind its creation.  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1: Honestly, your not a very good liar. I don't believe you one bit.<BR /><BR />3: I thought the void would actually like the advantage I gave them! I've actually offered several which they have turned down because the void consider them an OP attack.<BR /><BR />I'm leaving Roleplay, and I'll be happy to go. I finally found a game called mine craft. I might show occasional appearances (I'll bet a hundred dollars they are ignored) </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. That's because I'm not lying. You really think we've all made a plan to ignore you?<BR /><BR />3. That's because They Are an OP attack.<BR /><BR />See ya.

Krill took over as leader since Wish doesn't have as much time anymore, but he's still around somtimes.<BR />2. We're allied with The Swords of Light, which is Hovawart's group, but since he (Along with LEGO fan, and Meedled.) Are very inactive, BuckyKat is currently the only leader there, we're also allied with The Maelstrom which I am second in command of, and apparently we're also allies of one of Fire-Types HQs, The Confederacy, or something like that, and we all meet at The Dark Ring Empire (DRE.)<BR />3. We have these guys called the "rebellion" fighting us along with the Nexus Force, they are rather aubsurd at most times and made LU roleplay much less fun than it used to be, the worst of them would be Airdude500, he does, well a lot of annoying stuff, it would take way to long to just list them, after a few days to a week of his posts, you know what I mean, oh, I got it, to sum it up, he's worse than Mastergoalie.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Allow me to add something to three:<BR /><BR />So they're so bad and annoying but we still haven't come up with a reason why they're more OP than us<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Oh yeah, they also can't state any good reasons why WE are OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Unlike this gaggle of reasons I have here and have stated before.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1.

You critisize Alcubierres, even though you have and used Void portals.<BR />You also critisized Alcubierres right after you created black holes, with no context as I recall.<BR />You also said FELs were weapons of mass destruction, only a short while after using your Xindi superweapon. <BR /><BR />I can also name dozens of other hypocritical things. <BR /><BR />2. You have a problem with people giving others damage but no problem with people doing moves after your own but supposedly before yours? What?<BR /><BR />Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said.

I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR />2. If the defender thinks they should be able to do something different than the attacker stated, they normally say somthing.<BR /><BR /><BR />"Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?"<BR />I should have said Gamma rays instead of radiation, but why I won't accept them? You never gave me a simple explenation on why I should. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> <BR /><BR /><BR />"As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical."<BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!"<BR />I said I had problems with stargate things? I said I had problems with that battery, nothing else, (Yet..) because that battery isn't actually possible to create. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Not that I've seen atleast.<BR /> <BR /><BR />"I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me." <BR />Who said I was just blaming you? I said I was listing "THEY," as in everyone who called me OP, you were just talking about me, not my allies, I however, was talking about everybody who called me OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />I noticed you said nothing about m calling out Bane, does that meaan you agree with me after stating just that? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Maybe I should just try to keep it simple more often. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. There are atomic measurements. I ain't sure what ya mean.<BR /><BR />2. Well, Krill uses them.

Oooookay. <BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot. The population of the planet would most likely perish from the temperature changes, and the ecosystem of the planet would br ruined .<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yep. I agree 100% <BR /><BR />I think Bane's planet is lava, so I don't think you'd be ruining any landscapes<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />-puts on suit and tie, combs hair-<BR /><BR />"...Therefore, the court finds that 'planet moving' in the form illustrated by Bane to be gulity of the charges of being Over Powered..."<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />HIRED! You'd be a great lawyer<img class="emoticon emoticon-happy" id="happy" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/happy.png" alt="Happy" title="Happy" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Okay!

Krill took over as leader since Wish doesn't have as much time anymore, but he's still around somtimes.<BR />2. We're allied with The Swords of Light, which is Hovawart's group, but since he (Along with LEGO fan, and Meedled.) Are very inactive, BuckyKat is currently the only leader there, we're also allied with The Maelstrom which I am second in command of, and apparently we're also allies of one of Fire-Types HQs, The Confederacy, or something like that, and we all meet at The Dark Ring Empire (DRE.)<BR />3. We have these guys called the "rebellion" fighting us along with the Nexus Force, they are rather aubsurd at most times and made LU roleplay much less fun than it used to be, the worst of them would be Airdude500, he does, well a lot of annoying stuff, it would take way to long to just list them, after a few days to a week of his posts, you know what I mean, oh, I got it, to sum it up, he's worse than Mastergoalie.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Allow me to add something to three:<BR /><BR />So they're so bad and annoying but we still haven't come up with a reason why they're more OP than us<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Oh yeah, they also can't state any good reasons why WE are OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Unlike this gaggle of reasons I have here and have stated before.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You critisize technology that you yourself possess.<BR /><BR />2. You create roleplay moves that you make workable retroactively.<BR /><BR />What gaggle of reasons?

True. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Although, after reading this 4 times, I still don't see how this realtes to being OP.<BR /><BR />Now about you guys.<BR />Lets see, how many times have you guys (I'm covering everyone I can think of that have called me OP.) tried to make ships as large as our Harbingers in a really short amount of time if any at all, like, 5? <BR />"FEL" or whatever you call those things that pump out radiation.<BR />Two Words: Bane, Spartan.<BR />"Powering up" imagination, energies can't get "better" they can get more of it, but they can't get "better."<BR />Those batteries that take energy from different dimentions that you got from Stargate.<BR />Mistka, he may no longer be on your side, but he was, and he hasn't changed much in the entire time I've watched him, as in, he was Unrealistic when he started, and he's still unrealistic now.<BR /><BR />Thats off the top of my head, after thinking for about 5 minutes.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You critisize Alcubierres, even though you have and used Void portals.<BR />You also critisized Alcubierres right after you created black holes, with no context as I recall.<BR />You also said FELs were weapons of mass destruction, only a short while after using your Xindi superweapon. <BR /><BR />I can also name dozens of other hypocritical things. <BR /><BR />2. You have a problem with people giving others damage but no problem with people doing moves after your own but supposedly before yours? What?<BR /><BR />Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?<BR /><BR />As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical.<BR /><BR />You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!<BR /><BR />I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me.<BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR />2. If the defender thinks they should be able to do something different than the attacker stated, they normally say somthing.<BR /><BR /><BR />"Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?"<BR />I should have said Gamma rays instead of radiation, but why I won't accept them? You never gave me a simple explenation on why I should. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> <BR /><BR /><BR />"As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical."<BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!"<BR />I said I had problems with stargate things? I said I had problems with that battery, nothing else, (Yet..) because that battery isn't actually possible to create. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Not that I've seen atleast.<BR /> <BR /><BR />"I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me." <BR />Who said I was just blaming you? I said I was listing "THEY," as in everyone who called me OP, you were just talking about me, not my allies, I however, was talking about everybody who called me OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />I noticed you said nothing about m calling out Bane, does that meaan you agree with me after stating just that? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Maybe I should just try to keep it simple more often. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. There are atomic measurements. I ain't sure what ya mean.<BR /><BR />2. Well, Krill uses them. I'm dubious that most things under science fiction can be created<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />3. Oooookay. <BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot. The population of the planet would most likely perish from the temperature changes, and the ecosystem of the planet would br ruined .<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yep. I agree 100% <BR /><BR />I think Bane's planet is lava, so I don't think you'd be ruining any landscapes<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />-puts on suit and tie, combs hair-<BR /><BR />"...Therefore, the court finds that 'planet moving' in the form illustrated by Bane to be gulity of the charges of being Over Powered..."<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />HIRED! You'd be a great lawyer<img class="emoticon emoticon-happy" id="happy" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/happy.png" alt="Happy" title="Happy" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Okay! Thank you very much for the complement, I will see if I can't type up some Court for when we get moved to Classics. Stay tuned!<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Lieutenant, I currently have more forces at the LU Survivors topic than you. Stop(poorly) defending them and start actually allowing your ally to survive if you don't want two different enemies attacking you. Unless you want me to start strapping the world's largest engines onto Salvation, then you will accept that the Kingdom actually has basic technology and warp capability. And did anyone consider the possibility that warping need not be done by accelerating? Maybe I simply targeted the warp radius around the planet and fired the warp drive, using the tractor beams to keep it steady. ANd just so you know, I'd make an epic lawyer if I didn't get irritated by unintelligent arguments so easily. Actually, I got irritated at this rather foolish point of view, so I am actually correct!<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Wow... so confused by my own post.... Oh well, my move is fair, the DRE is OP and rude, case closed.<BR />-Bane

I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR />2.

Perfectly logical."<BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things?

Oooookay. <BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot. The population of the planet would most likely perish from the temperature changes, and the ecosystem of the planet would br ruined .<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yep. I agree 100% <BR /><BR />I think Bane's planet is lava, so I don't think you'd be ruining any landscapes<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />-puts on suit and tie, combs hair-<BR /><BR />"...Therefore, the court finds that 'planet moving' in the form illustrated by Bane to be gulity of the charges of being Over Powered..."<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />HIRED! You'd be a great lawyer<img class="emoticon emoticon-happy" id="happy" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/happy.png" alt="Happy" title="Happy" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Okay! Thank you very much for the complement, I will see if I can't type up some Court for when we get moved to Classics. Stay tuned!<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Lieutenant, I currently have more forces at the LU Survivors topic than you. Stop(poorly) defending them and start actually allowing your ally to survive if you don't want two different enemies attacking you. Unless you want me to start strapping the world's largest engines onto Salvation, then you will accept that the Kingdom actually has basic technology and warp capability. And did anyone consider the possibility that warping need not be done by accelerating? Maybe I simply targeted the warp radius around the planet and fired the warp drive, using the tractor beams to keep it steady. ANd just so you know, I'd make an epic lawyer if I didn't get irritated by unintelligent arguments so easily. Actually, I got irritated at this rather foolish point of view, so I am actually correct!<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Wow... so confused by my own post.... Oh well, my move is fair, the DRE is OP and rude, case closed.<BR />-Bane </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Bane, LL and many others bring up valid points. LL and I are friends and allies of you. Don't insult and ESPECIALLY don't threaten one of the best and kindest allies of the Galactic Alliance. There are billions of other problems, such as atmosphere, magnetic fields, time. There are thousands of problems that would require a lot of energy.

We're allied with The Swords of Light, which is Hovawart's group, but since he (Along with LEGO fan, and Meedled.) Are very inactive, BuckyKat is currently the only leader there, we're also allied with The Maelstrom which I am second in command of, and apparently we're also allies of one of Fire-Types HQs, The Confederacy, or something like that, and we all meet at The Dark Ring Empire (DRE.)<BR /><BR />3. We have these guys called the "rebellion" fighting us along with the Nexus Force, they are rather aubsurd at most times and made LU roleplay much less fun than it used to be, the worst of them would be Airdude500, he does, well a lot of annoying stuff, it would take way to long to just list them, after a few days to a week of his posts, you know what I mean, oh, I got it, to sum it up, he's worse than Mastergoalie.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Allow me to add something to three:<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />So they're so bad and annoying but we still haven't come up with a reason why they're more OP than us<IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Oh yeah, they also can't state any good reasons why WE are OP. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR />Unlike this gaggle of reasons I have here and have stated before.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;1.

You critisize Alcubierres, even though you have and used Void portals.<BR /><BR />You also critisized Alcubierres right after you created black holes, with no context as I recall.<BR /><BR />You also said FELs were weapons of mass destruction, only a short while after using your Xindi superweapon. <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I can also name dozens of other hypocritical things. <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2. You have a problem with people giving others damage but no problem with people doing moves after your own but supposedly before yours? What?<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said.

I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2.

So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said.

You never gave me a simple explenation on why I should. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />"As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical."<BR /><BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!"<BR /><BR />I said I had problems with stargate things? I said I had problems with that battery, nothing else, (Yet..) because that battery isn't actually possible to create. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR />Not that I've seen atleast.<BR /><BR /> <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />"I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me." <BR /><BR />Who said I was just blaming you? I said I was listing "THEY," as in everyone who called me OP, you were just talking about me, not my allies, I however, was talking about everybody who called me OP. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I noticed you said nothing about m calling out Bane, does that meaan you agree with me after stating just that? <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> Maybe I should just try to keep it simple more often. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;1. There are atomic measurements. I ain't sure what ya mean.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2. Well, Krill uses them. I'm dubious that most things under science fiction can be created<IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />3. Oooookay. <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR /><BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR /><BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot. The population of the planet would most likely perish from the temperature changes, and the ecosystem of the planet would br ruined .<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR /><BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU  </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Yep. I agree 100% <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I think Bane's planet is lava, so I don't think you'd be ruining any landscapes<IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;-puts on suit and tie, combs hair-<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />"...Therefore, the court finds that 'planet moving' in the form illustrated by Bane to be gulity of the charges of being Over Powered..."<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR /><BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;HIRED! You'd be a great lawyer<IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /> </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Okay! Thank you very much for the complement, I will see if I can't type up some Court for when we get moved to Classics. Stay tuned!<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR /><BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Lieutenant, I currently have more forces at the LU Survivors topic than you. Stop(poorly) defending them and start actually allowing your ally to survive if you don't want two different enemies attacking you. Unless you want me to start strapping the world's largest engines onto Salvation, then you will accept that the Kingdom actually has basic technology and warp capability. And did anyone consider the possibility that warping need not be done by accelerating? Maybe I simply targeted the warp radius around the planet and fired the warp drive, using the tractor beams to keep it steady. ANd just so you know, I'd make an epic lawyer if I didn't get irritated by unintelligent arguments so easily. Actually, I got irritated at this rather foolish point of view, so I am actually correct!<IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> Wow... so confused by my own post.... Oh well, my move is fair, the DRE is OP and rude, case closed.<BR /><BR />-Bane </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Bane, LL and many others bring up valid points. LL and I are friends and allies of you. Don't insult and ESPECIALLY don't threaten one of the best and kindest allies of the Galactic Alliance. There are billions of other problems, such as atmosphere, magnetic fields, time. There are thousands of problems that would require a lot of energy.  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />IDEA! How about both sides sign a treaty to send Bane into exile. Just a thought...<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />-/•\- Iønus -/•\-<BR />

You critisize Alcubierres, even though you have and used Void portals.<BR /><BR />You also critisized Alcubierres right after you created black holes, with no context as I recall.<BR /><BR />You also said FELs were weapons of mass destruction, only a short while after using your Xindi superweapon. <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I can also name dozens of other hypocritical things. <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2. You have a problem with people giving others damage but no problem with people doing moves after your own but supposedly before yours? What?<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said.

I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2.

So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said.

You never gave me a simple explenation on why I should. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />"As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical."<BR /><BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!"<BR /><BR />I said I had problems with stargate things? I said I had problems with that battery, nothing else, (Yet..) because that battery isn't actually possible to create. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR />Not that I've seen atleast.<BR /><BR /> <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />"I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me." <BR /><BR />Who said I was just blaming you? I said I was listing "THEY," as in everyone who called me OP, you were just talking about me, not my allies, I however, was talking about everybody who called me OP. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I noticed you said nothing about m calling out Bane, does that meaan you agree with me after stating just that? <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> Maybe I should just try to keep it simple more often. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;1. There are atomic measurements. I ain't sure what ya mean.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2. Well, Krill uses them. I'm dubious that most things under science fiction can be created<IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />3. Oooookay. <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR /><BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR /><BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot.

Stop(poorly) defending them and start actually allowing your ally to survive if you don't want two different enemies attacking you. Unless you want me to start strapping the world's largest engines onto Salvation, then you will accept that the Kingdom actually has basic technology and warp capability. And did anyone consider the possibility that warping need not be done by accelerating? Maybe I simply targeted the warp radius around the planet and fired the warp drive, using the tractor beams to keep it steady. ANd just so you know, I'd make an epic lawyer if I didn't get irritated by unintelligent arguments so easily. Actually, I got irritated at this rather foolish point of view, so I am actually correct!<IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> Wow... so confused by my own post.... Oh well, my move is fair, the DRE is OP and rude, case closed.<BR /><BR />-Bane </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Bane, LL and many others bring up valid points. LL and I are friends and allies of you. Don't insult and ESPECIALLY don't threaten one of the best and kindest allies of the Galactic Alliance. There are billions of other problems, such as atmosphere, magnetic fields, time. There are thousands of problems that would require a lot of energy.  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />IDEA! How about both sides sign a treaty to send Bane into exile.

You critisize Alcubierres, even though you have and used Void portals.<BR /><BR />You also critisized Alcubierres right after you created black holes, with no context as I recall.<BR /><BR />You also said FELs were weapons of mass destruction, only a short while after using your Xindi superweapon. <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I can also name dozens of other hypocritical things. <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2. You have a problem with people giving others damage but no problem with people doing moves after your own but supposedly before yours? What?<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />Um.

I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2.

So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?"<BR /><BR />I should have said Gamma rays instead of radiation, but why I won't accept them? You never gave me a simple explenation on why I should. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />"As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical."<BR /><BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!"<BR /><BR />I said I had problems with stargate things? I said I had problems with that battery, nothing else, (Yet..) because that battery isn't actually possible to create. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR />Not that I've seen atleast.<BR /><BR /> <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />"I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me." <BR /><BR />Who said I was just blaming you? I said I was listing "THEY," as in everyone who called me OP, you were just talking about me, not my allies, I however, was talking about everybody who called me OP. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I noticed you said nothing about m calling out Bane, does that meaan you agree with me after stating just that? <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> Maybe I should just try to keep it simple more often. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;1. There are atomic measurements. I ain't sure what ya mean.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2. Well, Krill uses them. I'm dubious that most things under science fiction can be created<IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />3. Oooookay. <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR /><BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR /><BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot. The population of the planet would most likely perish from the temperature changes, and the ecosystem of the planet would br ruined .<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR /><BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU  </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Yep. I agree 100% <BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />I think Bane's planet is lava, so I don't think you'd be ruining any landscapes<IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;-puts on suit and tie, combs hair-<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />"...Therefore, the court finds that 'planet moving' in the form illustrated by Bane to be gulity of the charges of being Over Powered..."<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR /><BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;HIRED! You'd be a great lawyer<IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt="Big Smile" /> </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Okay! Thank you very much for the complement, I will see if I can't type up some Court for when we get moved to Classics. Stay tuned!<BR /><BR /><BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR /><BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Lieutenant, I currently have more forces at the LU Survivors topic than you. Stop(poorly) defending them and start actually allowing your ally to survive if you don't want two different enemies attacking you. Unless you want me to start strapping the world's largest engines onto Salvation, then you will accept that the Kingdom actually has basic technology and warp capability. And did anyone consider the possibility that warping need not be done by accelerating? Maybe I simply targeted the warp radius around the planet and fired the warp drive, using the tractor beams to keep it steady. ANd just so you know, I'd make an epic lawyer if I didn't get irritated by unintelligent arguments so easily. Actually, I got irritated at this rather foolish point of view, so I am actually correct!<IMG src="/html/images/emoticons/emotion-4.gif" alt="Stick out tongue" /> Wow... so confused by my own post.... Oh well, my move is fair, the DRE is OP and rude, case closed.<BR /><BR />-Bane </DIV></BLOCKQUOTE>&lt;br/&gt;Bane, LL and many others bring up valid points. LL and I are friends and allies of you. Don't insult and ESPECIALLY don't threaten one of the best and kindest allies of the Galactic Alliance. There are billions of other problems, such as atmosphere, magnetic fields, time. There are thousands of problems that would require a lot of energy.  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />IDEA! How about both sides sign a treaty to send Bane into exile.

Perfectly logical."<BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things?

Oooookay. <BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation.

You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot. The population of the planet would most likely perish from the temperature changes, and the ecosystem of the planet would br ruined .<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yep. I agree 100% <BR /><BR />I think Bane's planet is lava, so I don't think you'd be ruining any landscapes<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />-puts on suit and tie, combs hair-<BR /><BR />"...Therefore, the court finds that 'planet moving' in the form illustrated by Bane to be gulity of the charges of being Over Powered..."<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />HIRED!

Stay tuned!<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Lieutenant, I currently have more forces at the LU Survivors topic than you. Stop(poorly) defending them and start actually allowing your ally to survive if you don't want two different enemies attacking you. Unless you want me to start strapping the world's largest engines onto Salvation, then you will accept that the Kingdom actually has basic technology and warp capability. And did anyone consider the possibility that warping need not be done by accelerating? Maybe I simply targeted the warp radius around the planet and fired the warp drive, using the tractor beams to keep it steady. ANd just so you know, I'd make an epic lawyer if I didn't get irritated by unintelligent arguments so easily. Actually, I got irritated at this rather foolish point of view, so I am actually correct!<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Wow... so confused by my own post.... Oh well, my move is fair, the DRE is OP and rude, case closed.<BR />-Bane </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Wait, what? This is an example of trolling and it was not a very lawyer-like argument. You completely tried to shut out all replies and did not state any facts (facts are the basis of evidence, no facts means no evidence, means no proof). You just said, 'Maybe I....." and then took that as fact and based you ruling of the planet moving ability off of that.that judgement cannot be sound.<BR /><BR />Also, why in the world did you say, "You don't want two different enemies attacking you."? Would you actually attack the Survivors? <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU

Krill took over as leader since Wish doesn't have as much time anymore, but he's still around somtimes.<BR />2. We're allied with The Swords of Light, which is Hovawart's group, but since he (Along with LEGO fan, and Meedled.) Are very inactive, BuckyKat is currently the only leader there, we're also allied with The Maelstrom which I am second in command of, and apparently we're also allies of one of Fire-Types HQs, The Confederacy, or something like that, and we all meet at The Dark Ring Empire (DRE.)<BR />3. We have these guys called the "rebellion" fighting us along with the Nexus Force, they are rather aubsurd at most times and made LU roleplay much less fun than it used to be, the worst of them would be Airdude500, he does, well a lot of annoying stuff, it would take way to long to just list them, after a few days to a week of his posts, you know what I mean, oh, I got it, to sum it up, he's worse than Mastergoalie.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Allow me to add something to three:<BR /><BR />So they're so bad and annoying but we still haven't come up with a reason why they're more OP than us<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Oh yeah, they also can't state any good reasons why WE are OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Unlike this gaggle of reasons I have here and have stated before.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1.

True. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Although, after reading this 4 times, I still don't see how this realtes to being OP.<BR /><BR />Now about you guys.<BR />Lets see, how many times have you guys (I'm covering everyone I can think of that have called me OP.) tried to make ships as large as our Harbingers in a really short amount of time if any at all, like, 5? <BR />"FEL" or whatever you call those things that pump out radiation.<BR />Two Words: Bane, Spartan.<BR />"Powering up" imagination, energies can't get "better" they can get more of it, but they can't get "better."<BR />Those batteries that take energy from different dimentions that you got from Stargate.<BR />Mistka, he may no longer be on your side, but he was, and he hasn't changed much in the entire time I've watched him, as in, he was Unrealistic when he started, and he's still unrealistic now.<BR /><BR />Thats off the top of my head, after thinking for about 5 minutes.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You critisize Alcubierres, even though you have and used Void portals.<BR />You also critisized Alcubierres right after you created black holes, with no context as I recall.<BR />You also said FELs were weapons of mass destruction, only a short while after using your Xindi superweapon. <BR /><BR />I can also name dozens of other hypocritical things. <BR /><BR />2. You have a problem with people giving others damage but no problem with people doing moves after your own but supposedly before yours? What?<BR /><BR />Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?<BR /><BR />As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical.<BR /><BR />You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!<BR /><BR />I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me.<BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR />2. If the defender thinks they should be able to do something different than the attacker stated, they normally say somthing.<BR /><BR /><BR />"Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?"<BR />I should have said Gamma rays instead of radiation, but why I won't accept them? You never gave me a simple explenation on why I should. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> <BR /><BR /><BR />"As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical."<BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!"<BR />I said I had problems with stargate things? I said I had problems with that battery, nothing else, (Yet..) because that battery isn't actually possible to create. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Not that I've seen atleast.<BR /> <BR /><BR />"I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me." <BR />Who said I was just blaming you? I said I was listing "THEY," as in everyone who called me OP, you were just talking about me, not my allies, I however, was talking about everybody who called me OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />I noticed you said nothing about m calling out Bane, does that meaan you agree with me after stating just that? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Maybe I should just try to keep it simple more often. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. There are atomic measurements. I ain't sure what ya mean.<BR /><BR />2. Well, Krill uses them. I'm dubious that most things under science fiction can be created<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />3. Oooookay. <BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot. The population of the planet would most likely perish from the temperature changes, and the ecosystem of the planet would br ruined .<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yep. I agree 100% <BR /><BR />I think Bane's planet is lava, so I don't think you'd be ruining any landscapes<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />-puts on suit and tie, combs hair-<BR /><BR />"...Therefore, the court finds that 'planet moving' in the form illustrated by Bane to be gulity of the charges of being Over Powered..."<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />HIRED! You'd be a great lawyer<img class="emoticon emoticon-happy" id="happy" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/happy.png" alt="Happy" title="Happy" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Okay! Thank you very much for the complement, I will see if I can't type up some Court for when we get moved to Classics. Stay tuned!<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Lieutenant, I currently have more forces at the LU Survivors topic than you. Stop(poorly) defending them and start actually allowing your ally to survive if you don't want two different enemies attacking you. Unless you want me to start strapping the world's largest engines onto Salvation, then you will accept that the Kingdom actually has basic technology and warp capability. And did anyone consider the possibility that warping need not be done by accelerating? Maybe I simply targeted the warp radius around the planet and fired the warp drive, using the tractor beams to keep it steady. ANd just so you know, I'd make an epic lawyer if I didn't get irritated by unintelligent arguments so easily. Actually, I got irritated at this rather foolish point of view, so I am actually correct!<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Wow... so confused by my own post.... Oh well, my move is fair, the DRE is OP and rude, case closed.<BR />-Bane </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Bane, LL and many others bring up valid points. LL and I are friends and allies of you. Don't insult and ESPECIALLY don't threaten one of the best and kindest allies of the Galactic Alliance. There are billions of other problems, such as atmosphere, magnetic fields, time. There are thousands of problems that would require a lot of energy.  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Thank you. I'm just going to leave it at that.<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU

Krill took over as leader since Wish doesn't have as much time anymore, but he's still around somtimes.<BR />2. We're allied with The Swords of Light, which is Hovawart's group, but since he (Along with LEGO fan, and Meedled.) Are very inactive, BuckyKat is currently the only leader there, we're also allied with The Maelstrom which I am second in command of, and apparently we're also allies of one of Fire-Types HQs, The Confederacy, or something like that, and we all meet at The Dark Ring Empire (DRE.)<BR />3. We have these guys called the "rebellion" fighting us along with the Nexus Force, they are rather aubsurd at most times and made LU roleplay much less fun than it used to be, the worst of them would be Airdude500, he does, well a lot of annoying stuff, it would take way to long to just list them, after a few days to a week of his posts, you know what I mean, oh, I got it, to sum it up, he's worse than Mastergoalie.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Allow me to add something to three:<BR /><BR />So they're so bad and annoying but we still haven't come up with a reason why they're more OP than us<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Oh yeah, they also can't state any good reasons why WE are OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Unlike this gaggle of reasons I have here and have stated before.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1.

You critisize Alcubierres, even though you have and used Void portals.<BR />You also critisized Alcubierres right after you created black holes, with no context as I recall.<BR />You also said FELs were weapons of mass destruction, only a short while after using your Xindi superweapon. <BR /><BR />I can also name dozens of other hypocritical things. <BR /><BR />2. You have a problem with people giving others damage but no problem with people doing moves after your own but supposedly before yours? What?<BR /><BR />Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?<BR /><BR />As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure.

I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR />2. If the defender thinks they should be able to do something different than the attacker stated, they normally say somthing.<BR /><BR /><BR />"Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?"<BR />I should have said Gamma rays instead of radiation, but why I won't accept them? You never gave me a simple explenation on why I should. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> <BR /><BR /><BR />"As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical."<BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!"<BR />I said I had problems with stargate things? I said I had problems with that battery, nothing else, (Yet..) because that battery isn't actually possible to create. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Not that I've seen atleast.<BR /> <BR /><BR />"I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me." <BR />Who said I was just blaming you? I said I was listing "THEY," as in everyone who called me OP, you were just talking about me, not my allies, I however, was talking about everybody who called me OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />I noticed you said nothing about m calling out Bane, does that meaan you agree with me after stating just that? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Maybe I should just try to keep it simple more often. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. There are atomic measurements. I ain't sure what ya mean.<BR /><BR />2. Well, Krill uses them. I'm dubious that most things under science fiction can be created<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />3. Oooookay. <BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot. The population of the planet would most likely perish from the temperature changes, and the ecosystem of the planet would br ruined .<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yep. I agree 100% <BR /><BR />I think Bane's planet is lava, so I don't think you'd be ruining any landscapes<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />-puts on suit and tie, combs hair-<BR /><BR />"...Therefore, the court finds that 'planet moving' in the form illustrated by Bane to be gulity of the charges of being Over Powered..."<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />HIRED! You'd be a great lawyer<img class="emoticon emoticon-happy" id="happy" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/happy.png" alt="Happy" title="Happy" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Okay! Thank you very much for the complement, I will see if I can't type up some Court for when we get moved to Classics. Stay tuned!<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Lieutenant, I currently have more forces at the LU Survivors topic than you. Stop(poorly) defending them and start actually allowing your ally to survive if you don't want two different enemies attacking you. Unless you want me to start strapping the world's largest engines onto Salvation, then you will accept that the Kingdom actually has basic technology and warp capability. And did anyone consider the possibility that warping need not be done by accelerating? Maybe I simply targeted the warp radius around the planet and fired the warp drive, using the tractor beams to keep it steady. ANd just so you know, I'd make an epic lawyer if I didn't get irritated by unintelligent arguments so easily. Actually, I got irritated at this rather foolish point of view, so I am actually correct!<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Wow... so confused by my own post.... Oh well, my move is fair, the DRE is OP and rude, case closed.<BR />-Bane </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Wait, what? This is an example of trolling and it was not a very lawyer-like argument. You completely tried to shut out all replies and did not state any facts (facts are the basis of evidence, no facts means no evidence, means no proof). You just said, 'Maybe I....." and then took that as fact and based you ruling of the planet moving ability off of that.that judgement cannot be sound.<BR /><BR />Also, why in the world did you say, "You don't want two different enemies attacking you."? Would you actually attack the Survivors? <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. This is not trollling. Trolling would be simply insulting people, screaming at them, swearing, etc.<BR />2. Yes, I would attack the Survivors. You may be considered civilians protected by the GA, but that doesn't mean I can't crush you like a gnat with only my blade.<BR />3. I was simply suggesting an alternate method of explaining it and obeying physics. If everyone would get off my back about perfectly fair moves, then I will use this as my explanation. Until then, I plan to simply say I towed it, just to prove how volatile and angry you guys are at... everything.<BR />4. Until you can find some argument against me that I can't counter, you will have no method to make my moves invalid. You wouldn't want me to have the first military use of Project Gamma be on the Survivors, now would you?<BR />-Bane

Krill took over as leader since Wish doesn't have as much time anymore, but he's still around somtimes.<BR />2. We're allied with The Swords of Light, which is Hovawart's group, but since he (Along with LEGO fan, and Meedled.) Are very inactive, BuckyKat is currently the only leader there, we're also allied with The Maelstrom which I am second in command of, and apparently we're also allies of one of Fire-Types HQs, The Confederacy, or something like that, and we all meet at The Dark Ring Empire (DRE.)<BR />3. We have these guys called the "rebellion" fighting us along with the Nexus Force, they are rather aubsurd at most times and made LU roleplay much less fun than it used to be, the worst of them would be Airdude500, he does, well a lot of annoying stuff, it would take way to long to just list them, after a few days to a week of his posts, you know what I mean, oh, I got it, to sum it up, he's worse than Mastergoalie.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Allow me to add something to three:<BR /><BR />So they're so bad and annoying but we still haven't come up with a reason why they're more OP than us<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Oh yeah, they also can't state any good reasons why WE are OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Unlike this gaggle of reasons I have here and have stated before.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1.

True. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Although, after reading this 4 times, I still don't see how this realtes to being OP.<BR /><BR />Now about you guys.<BR />Lets see, how many times have you guys (I'm covering everyone I can think of that have called me OP.) tried to make ships as large as our Harbingers in a really short amount of time if any at all, like, 5? <BR />"FEL" or whatever you call those things that pump out radiation.<BR />Two Words: Bane, Spartan.<BR />"Powering up" imagination, energies can't get "better" they can get more of it, but they can't get "better."<BR />Those batteries that take energy from different dimentions that you got from Stargate.<BR />Mistka, he may no longer be on your side, but he was, and he hasn't changed much in the entire time I've watched him, as in, he was Unrealistic when he started, and he's still unrealistic now.<BR /><BR />Thats off the top of my head, after thinking for about 5 minutes.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You critisize Alcubierres, even though you have and used Void portals.<BR />You also critisized Alcubierres right after you created black holes, with no context as I recall.<BR />You also said FELs were weapons of mass destruction, only a short while after using your Xindi superweapon. <BR /><BR />I can also name dozens of other hypocritical things. <BR /><BR />2. You have a problem with people giving others damage but no problem with people doing moves after your own but supposedly before yours? What?<BR /><BR />Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?<BR /><BR />As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical.<BR /><BR />You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!<BR /><BR />I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me.<BR /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. I've yet to attack any of your ships with Void portals, and I've never used any "Xindi" super weapon, ever.<BR /><BR />2. If the defender thinks they should be able to do something different than the attacker stated, they normally say somthing.<BR /><BR /><BR />"Um. You have a problem with radiation? So we're outlawing lasers now? The gamma ray thing was wrong, as I've said. You would think it was op if I used a microwave to attack ya?"<BR />I should have said Gamma rays instead of radiation, but why I won't accept them? You never gave me a simple explenation on why I should. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> <BR /><BR /><BR />"As I've told you before, and as BK himself spoke of, imagination was restored by increasing its mass/cellular structure. Perfectly logical."<BR />Energys come toghether and bind to become a singular mass which is slightly more resilliant, you can compress energies, but heres where the problemo's come in, it's impossilbe to keep track of how much energy you have, or how much you had to start, since you don't have any standered unit to confirm how much you have, it's the same reason why no RP's have a monitary system, because it's impossilbe to keep track of it all, Maelstrom exists because we just randomly thought up numbers that seemed reasonable. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />"You have a problem with the stargate things? Rack that up on the hypocritical list! You use them too!"<BR />I said I had problems with stargate things? I said I had problems with that battery, nothing else, (Yet..) because that battery isn't actually possible to create. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR />Not that I've seen atleast.<BR /> <BR /><BR />"I've talked to Mistika before. If people are op, and I can't change anything, don't blame me." <BR />Who said I was just blaming you? I said I was listing "THEY," as in everyone who called me OP, you were just talking about me, not my allies, I however, was talking about everybody who called me OP. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />I noticed you said nothing about m calling out Bane, does that meaan you agree with me after stating just that? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Maybe I should just try to keep it simple more often. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. There are atomic measurements. I ain't sure what ya mean.<BR /><BR />2. Well, Krill uses them. I'm dubious that most things under science fiction can be created<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /><BR /><BR />3. Oooookay. <BR /><BR />I don't like the Salvation. There are movable planets, or rather planets that move in nonorbital motions, but planet towing is crazy.<BR /><BR />I've not kept up with most of his moves, so I can't give you my opinion on him. </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. You care to keep explicit track of how much imagination you have, and how much "powered up" imagination you have, constantly? Give me some reasonable data and show me through a prolonged test that kind of system could work, then I would agree to "powering up" energies being reasonable.<BR /><BR />2. Then how about you can go tell Krill when he gets back? <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Many things in science fiction could be made, like quite a few things in the Star Wars universe are possible, lightsabers could be possible, but you would need an incredibly powerful energy source in a small crystaline form.<BR /><BR />3. Towing a planet isn't exactly impossilbe, lets take earth for example, if we got 4 harbingers with many, many smaller ships helping, we might be able to tow it. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> (Eh, maybe, when you take into account simple physical laws, but I'm not savvy in that department, you should ask Barcha. <img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" />) but as none of us has those kinds of resources it would be impossilbe as of now.<BR />Thats a fair answer, although you seem to be everywhere in this RP so it makes me dubious.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Towing a planet would be (theoretically) impossible for three reasons in my mind:<BR /><BR />1.) An object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion. A hugely massive planet orbiting through space at tremendous speed would not like to have its position changed, inertia wants to keep it moving as it is. This point leads into the next one nicely...<BR /><BR />2.) How in the world would you harness enough power to move an entire planet? Even more so, how would you direct that energy so that the planet moves? Overcoming the gravity of the object which the planet orbits around is only step one, keeping that planet from falling back into orbit or becoming caught in another object gravitational pull is the next (theoretically) impossible step. Finally...<BR /><BR />3.) The planet must have something to hold it in place once it gets to the desired location. Again inertia caused a problem here. You would have to continually push and pull the planet to manuever it into the perfect location so that it falls back into a orbitally pattern.<BR /><BR />I agree that this planet moving thing is not (theoretically) possible <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yeah, you explained that nicely, I mean it WOULD be possible to do such a thing theoreticly, it isn't out right impossible, but it would require so much energy that it is rather impossible for anyone to achive as of now.<BR /><BR /><BR />-=Soranos=- </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Another problem would be the ecosystem on the planet. Let's use the comet of Frostburg as an example because it would be easier to move than an entire planet. Frostburg stays in its perpetual state of winter because of its distance from the sun, when it passes nearest to the sun, it unthaws and mini figures can visit it. The moment you start to move it, flying it past other stars or planets, the temperature on the planet would rapidly fluctuate from extremely cold to scaldingly hot. The population of the planet would most likely perish from the temperature changes, and the ecosystem of the planet would br ruined .<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU  </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Yep. I agree 100% <BR /><BR />I think Bane's planet is lava, so I don't think you'd be ruining any landscapes<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />-puts on suit and tie, combs hair-<BR /><BR />"...Therefore, the court finds that 'planet moving' in the form illustrated by Bane to be gulity of the charges of being Over Powered..."<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />HIRED! You'd be a great lawyer<img class="emoticon emoticon-happy" id="happy" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/happy.png" alt="Happy" title="Happy" /> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Okay! Thank you very much for the complement, I will see if I can't type up some Court for when we get moved to Classics. Stay tuned!<BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Lieutenant, I currently have more forces at the LU Survivors topic than you. Stop(poorly) defending them and start actually allowing your ally to survive if you don't want two different enemies attacking you. Unless you want me to start strapping the world's largest engines onto Salvation, then you will accept that the Kingdom actually has basic technology and warp capability. And did anyone consider the possibility that warping need not be done by accelerating? Maybe I simply targeted the warp radius around the planet and fired the warp drive, using the tractor beams to keep it steady. ANd just so you know, I'd make an epic lawyer if I didn't get irritated by unintelligent arguments so easily. Actually, I got irritated at this rather foolish point of view, so I am actually correct!<img class="emoticon emoticon-joking" id="joking" src="https://lego.i.lithium.com/lego/i/emoticons/joking.png" alt="Joking" title="Joking" /> Wow... so confused by my own post.... Oh well, my move is fair, the DRE is OP and rude, case closed.<BR />-Bane </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Wait, what? This is an example of trolling and it was not a very lawyer-like argument. You completely tried to shut out all replies and did not state any facts (facts are the basis of evidence, no facts means no evidence, means no proof). You just said, 'Maybe I....." and then took that as fact and based you ruling of the planet moving ability off of that.that judgement cannot be sound.<BR /><BR />Also, why in the world did you say, "You don't want two different enemies attacking you."? Would you actually attack the Survivors? <BR /><BR />LieutenantLafayette<BR />MarlomFirebrush formerly in LU </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />1. This is not trollling. Trolling would be simply insulting people, screaming at them, swearing, etc.<BR />2. Yes, I would attack the Survivors. You may be considered civilians protected by the GA, but that doesn't mean I can't crush you like a gnat with only my blade.<BR />3. I was simply suggesting an alternate method of explaining it and obeying physics. If everyone would get off my back about perfectly fair moves, then I will use this as my explanation. Until then, I plan to simply say I towed it, just to prove how volatile and angry you guys are at... everything.<BR />4. Until you can find some argument against me that I can't counter, you will have no method to make my moves invalid. You wouldn't want me to have the first military use of Project Gamma be on the Survivors, now would you?<BR />-Bane </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE><BR />Okay Bane. I'm drawing the line. You just threatened allies of the GA as well as citizens of them. You're bringing OOC into the IC. Stop this. The Rebellion will fall apart if petty arguments like this start. <BR />
