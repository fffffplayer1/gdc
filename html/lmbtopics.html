		<p>The General Discussion Coalition (or GDC) is the union of several Wikis, created by the same group of friends in order to accommodate their stories and other relevant information. The Wikis are united in that they all share General Discussion topics named "Thought we could this for general discussion" or in a similar manner, hence the name.</p>
		<h2>Placeholder Title</h2>
		<p>Just placing some words here, don't mind me. fffffffff fffffffff hrsyshsjty fsthssjyj ffffffffffffffffffffffff fffffffffffff ffffffffffffff ffffffff fffffffffff fffff ffffffffff ffffffffff fffffffff fffffffffffff fffffffff</p>
		<p>Sorry. It would seem these aren't really real words, are they? Maybe somewhere they communicate with words made solely with fs, though? Perhaps. What would fffff mean then? Well, we could always take it for 0xfffff which is 1024^2-1 I think. It would appear to be the number 1048575. Let's see if those are equal. Yeah, made the calculations and it's right.</p>
		<p>What else can I say here?</p>
		<p>Oh, you don't know what all that stuff concerning 0xfffff was about? Yeah, it makes sense that some of you don't. 0x means that the following number is in hexadecimal. Hexadecimal is like binary, if you're familiar with that, only it's got sixteen digits: 0, 1, 2, 3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8 , 9, A, B, C, D, E and F (where F for instance is 15 and 10 is 16)</p>
		<p>If you know what hexadecimal is, don't be offended of course. Just making sure everyone is on the same page... This webpage! Haha! Don't throw rocks at me.</p>
		<h2>Let's make this one a  title shall we?</h2>
		<p>More words are required. Please donate some, it's for a good cause.</p>
		<p>What's new from you guys?</p>
