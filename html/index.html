		<p>The General Discussion Coalition (or GDC) is the union of several Wikis, created by the same group of friends in order to accommodate their stories and other relevant information. The Wikis are united in that they all share General Discussion topics named "Thought we could this for general discussion" or in a similar manner, hence the name.</p>
		<h2>About this place</h2>
		<p>The Knights of the Olde Speech, the primary contributors of the GDC, are a group that was founded in the LEGO Message Boards. We like Olde Speech, we write stories and we generally have fun together.</p>
		<p>At some point, we migrated from the LEGO Message Boards (may they rest in rip) to Wikia (which is a far better name than Fandom; fite me!) where we continued to write and host our stories. However, soon a lot of us started making our personal wikis for our respective series and that left us with the issue of having various different wikis to check out for new activity. So, for a long time now I've wanted to create a central hub that would unite our wikis together. That is why I created this website, hoping it would serve this purpose exactly.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, before the LEGO Message Boards were shut down, some people, myself included, sought to create archives of the forums. So, I've held to these archives for some time and while I did share download links for them, I knew that the general public wouldn't find them very accessible. As such, after editing one of the earlier (and messier) archives to make it more user-friendly, I had the idea of hosting them on GitHub, thus avoiding the process of downloading and digging through the files (which would generally be more than you need). Storage has always been a main concern with how one would go about sharing those, too, and I might have a solution for that with this approach. If anything, I can at least share some of the topics I have saved. If you're here for these archives, head over the <a href="lmbarchives.html">LMB Archives</a> page to see what's currently uploaded.</p>
		<p>In any case, I hope you will enjoy your stay here and if you want to discuss matters of a general subject, you know whom to call and it's not the Ghost Busters.</p>
		<h2>Recent Activity</h2>

			    <p>Hello there, person. If you see this, then that means I haven't completed the code for this section, yet, or it is malfunctioning. Well, this is a little embarrassing. I guess you could call this an 'Error 404: Recent Activity not found' kind of thing, though.</p>
			    <p>Hmm. Well, while we wait, we might as well do something... I guess bribing you with cookies to not feel cheated about the apparent lack of recent-activity-ing <em>is</em> doing something.</p>
			    <p>Here, do you want a cookie? <img src='../images/Cookie.png' alt="Uuuhm. This is even more embarrassing. You can't even see the cookie? I really hope you don't come with torches and pitchforks yelling that the cookie was a lie. Let's limit ourselves to the cake, don't you agree?"></img></p>
